This edition includes far-reaching suggestions for research that could increase the impact that classroom teaching has on actual learning.the original edition, this book offers exciting new research about the mind and the brain that provides answers to a number of compelling questions. When do infants begin to learn? How do experts learn and how is this different from non-experts? What can teachers and schools do-with curricula, classroom settings, and teaching methods2̆014to help children learn most effectively? New evidence from many branches of science has significantly added to our understanding of what it means to know, from the neural processes that occur during learning to the influence of culture on what people see and absorb.People Learn examines these findings and their implications for what we teach, how we teach it, and how we assess what our children learn. The book uses exemplary teaching to illustrate how approaches based on what we now know result in in-depth learning. This new knowledge calls into question concepts and practices firmly entrenched in our current education system.include:How learning actually changes the physical structure of the brain.How existing knowledge affects what people notice and how they learn.What the thought processes of experts tell us about how to teach.The amazing learning potential of infants.The relationship of classroom learning and everyday settings of community and workplace.Learning needs and opportunities for teachers.A realistic look at the role of technology in education.",

    "abstract": "Newton’s remarkable achievements in planetary theory and dynamics were followed by a century of equally remarkable advances in the generalized science of forces acting on bodies in motion. Far from merelyformalizing the Newtonian framework, these advances aimed at solving deep problems left in Newton’s wake. First, Newtonian theory focused on centripetal forces, which are not characteristic of motion under arbitrary constraints or bodily deformation due to pressure and stress. Second, Newton’s attempts at fluid mechanics made clear that media could not be adequately analyzed using strategies developed for point-particles. Both considerations suggested that different forms of body required different analytical and conceptual tools. They required the formulation of generalized principles flexible enough to treat heterogeneous material configurations, but stringent enough to preserve the unity of mechanics as a study of matter and motion. Ultimately, Newton’s successors established a new discipline, analytical mechanics. Its primary object of investigation was the functional representation of the invariant relations behind dynamic phenomena, not the geometric representation of trajectories. The philosophical suppositions behind the new mechanics constituted a new mechanical philosophy, but one that hearkened back to, and completed the project of, the mechanical philosophy of the mid-seventeenth century.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we use George E. Smith’s notion of “working hypotheses” to explicate the logic of theory mediation in Newton’s Principia. While much work on theory mediation focuses on how theory-mediated measurements fix theoretical parameters, we focus on how they allow phenomena to be constituted and individuated. This lets us locate in Smith’s work two types of evidence to which working hypotheses can appeal: what we call ‘conditional and “independent” evidence. Considering their relative merits allows us to extend Smith’s account of theory-mediation. Ultimately, we argue that Smith’s nuanced portrait of Newton’s non-Cartesian methodology opens up a way of appreciating how choices of mathematical formalism can themselves be considered working hypotheses.",

    "abstract": "Kepler is known today for his three planetary laws and his insistence on constructing astronomy based on physics rather than on geometry alone. This makes Kepler’s work seem like a natural predecessor to Newton’s achievement in the Principia. The Keplerian tradition in England that Newton inherited, however, typically only included parts of Kepler’s physical astronomy. This was an understandable response to the conceptual and computational problems that Kepler’s theory introduced. This article examines those problems, along with the transmission of Kepler’s theory to Newton. Special emphasis will be paid to Thomas Streete’s Astronomia Carolina, a Keplerian astronomy with tables, along with the notes Newton made on Streete’s work in the Questiones notebook between 1664 and 1665.",

    "abstract": "In some respects, there is more agreement between Newton and Leibniz on the relativity of motion than is generally recognized. Both were convinced Copernicans, and both accepted that motion could not be a merely extrinsic denomination—there would have to be true motions, and not just apparent ones. And both sought to discriminate true from apparent motions by reference to the causes of motion and to force. Where they differed was in their radically divergent understandings of how causes are related to forces, of how forces are to be determined in relation to quantity of motion, and of the ontological status of absolute or mathematical space. This chapter aims to throw light on the two philosophers’ respective views on the relativity of motion by considering them in their historical genesis.",

    "abstract": "This article examines Berkeley’s responses to the mechanics and mathematics of Isaac Newton. After a brief section outlining some of the key elements of Berkeley’s idealistic metaphysics and empiricist epistemology, his criticisms of Newton are considered, as is his attempt to accommodate the success of Newtonian mechanics within the constraints of his own philosophy. In particular, investigations are made of Berkeley’s criticisms of absolute space and time, his proposal to expunge the notion of matter from natural philosophy, his claim that laws of nature are purely descriptive and do not identify genuine causes, and his instrumentalistic approach to the concept of force. Berkeley’s critique of the Newtonian calculus of fluxions in his 1734 treatise The Analyst is also investigated.",

Commentators allege (1) that the idea of power causes problems for Locke’s taxonomy of ideas, (2) that it is defined circularly, and (3) that, contrary to Locke’s claims, it cannot be acquired in experience. This paper defends Locke’s account. Previous commentators have assumed that there is only one idea of power. But close attention to Locke’s text, combined with background features of his theory of ideas, supports the drawing of a distinction between four different ideas of power. The paper describes each idea and its role in the Essay. It then argues that this distinction can help Locke to avoid the traditional criticisms.",

    "abstract": "Public participation in scientific research has gained prominence in many scientific fields, but the theory of participatory research is still limited. In this paper, we suggest that the divergence of values and goals between academic researchers and public participants in research is key to analyzing the different forms this research takes. We examine two existing characterizations of participatory research: one in terms of public participants’ role in the research, the other in terms of the virtues of the research. In our view, each of these captures an important feature of participatory research but is, on its own, limited in what features it takes into account. We introduce an expanded conception of norms of collaboration that extends to both academic researchers and public participants. We suggest that satisfying these norms requires consideration of the two groups’ possibly divergent values and goals, and that a broad characterization of participatory research that starts from participants’ values and goals can motivate both public participants’ role in the research and the virtues of the research. The resulting framework clarifies the similarities and differences among participatory projects and can help guide the responsible design of such projects.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThis essay provides solutions to the puzzles surrounding the meaning and development of Isaac Newton’s famous “Rules of Philosophizing.” It charts afresh the shift from the “Hypotheses” of the first edition of the Principia (1687) to the “Rules” of the second (1713). A completely new rule of philosophizing from an intermediate stage, when the rules were to be called “Axioms,” is presented: it contains Newton’s first ever planned attack on “hypotheses” as part of the Principia. Subsequently, the meaning and purpose of the notoriously ambiguous Hypothesis III and Rule III become clear. They were developed as part of an argument against the possibility of weightless matter, an issue of immense importance to Newton’s immediate supporters and opponents. As Newton introduced what would become Rule III, he gradually realized that it offered the inductive reasoning that underpinned both this polemical argument and the broader case for the universality of gravitation and other fundamental qualities: extension, impenetrability, inertia, and mobility. Hypothesis III could be removed and the argument against weightless matter confined to Corollary 2 to Proposition 6 of Book III. The Rules were not abstract methodological principles but were designed with a very specific polemical purpose in mind.",

    "abstract": "Since the collapse of the ’received view’ consensus in the late 1960s, the question of scientific realism has been a major preoccupation of philosophers of science. This paper sketches the history of this debate, which grew from developments in the philosophy of language, but eventually took on an autonomous existence. More recently, the debate has tended towards more ’local’ considerations of particular scientific episodes as a way of getting purchase on the issues. The paper reviews two such approaches, Fine’s and Hacking’s, describing their positions, their prospects, and how they are related. Finally, the paper suggests that local philosophies of science offer a way for our discipline to engage more fruitfully with the public and the scientific community.",

However, certain crucial issues from thirty years ago are reprised in current discussions; specifically: whether the diversity of models in the science can be captured by some unitary account; and whether the temporal dimension of scientific practice can be represented by such an account. After reviewing recent developments we suggest that these issues can be accommodated within the partial structures formulation of the semantic or model-theoretic approach.",

This paper assesses what, with hindsight, seem the most important defects in the Received View; surveys the main proposed successor analyses to the Received View–various Semantic Conception versions and the Structuralist Analysis; evaluates how well they avoid those defects; examines what new problems they face and where the most promising require further development or leave unanswered questions; explores implications of recent work on models for understanding theories; and rebuts the few criticisms of the Semantic Conception that have surfaced.",

    "abstract": "Publisher Summary This chapter describes Hume’s argument about induction and offers some criticism of it along with its conclusion. It also reviews few popular philosophical responses to Hume’s argument. Hume’s argument is generally presented as targeting inductive reasoning. The argument essentially exploits the differences between induction and deduction. A contradiction is involved for the building of a good deductive argument to be true, but its conclusion to be false. A good deductive argument is necessarily truth preserving. As per Hume’s argument, an inductive argument cannot be used to justify inferring an inductive argument’s conclusion from its premises on pain of circularity. Also, a deductive argument cannot be used to justify this as there is no deductive argument from the premises of an inductive argument to its conclusion. Hence, there is no way to justify the step from an inductive argument’s premises to its conclusion. In conclusion, Hume states that one is not entitled to opinions regarding what one has not observed.",

At the beginning, induction was understood as it had been throughout the medieval period, as a kind of propositional inference that is stronger the more it approximates deduction. During the Renaissance, an older understanding, one prevalent in antiquity, was rediscovered and adopted. By this understanding, induction identifies defining characteristics using a process of comparing and contrasting.",

    "abstract": "\"The Earth’s deep past is a fascinating place to visit, both disturbingly alien and hauntingly familiar. In its life, the Earth has frozen solid, supported enormous animals (themselves sporting enormous fleas!), accommodated a diversity of cultures, and a diversity of ways-of-living. Rock, Bone & Ruin asks how much we can know about the deep past. To answer this, we need to understand the resources at our disposal: how do historical scientists like paleontologists, archaeologists and geologists learn about prehistory? Most people think of simple relationships–such as that between a fossilized bone and its long-dead owner–when they consider historical evidence. However, I argue that such scientists are best understood as ’methodological omnivores’: they are creative, opportunistic and use a variety of different strategies and techniques. The reasoning used by historical scientists is much more diverse and complex than we have previously realized. And this supports optimism about our capacity to discover the deep past: our knowledge of it shall continue to grow. Along the way, we critically examine philosophical and scientific reflection on the relationship between the past and the present, the nature of evidence, contingency, scientific progress and scientific. Further, I provide suggestions about the value of knowledge about the past–including how it can inform us in the present and into the future–and how such sciences are best supported. The argument draws on fascinating examples from across paleontology, geology and archaeology\"–",

    "abstract": "I argue that Isaac Newton’s De Gravitatione should not be considered an authoritative expression of his thought about the metaphysics of space and its relation to physical inquiry. I establish the following narrative: In De Gravitatione (circa 1668–1684), Newton claimed he had direct experimental evidence for the work’s central thesis: that space had “its own manner of existing” as an affection or emanative effect. In the 1710s, however, through the prodding of both Roger Cotes and G. W. Leibniz, he came to see that this evidence relied on assumptions that his own Principia rendered unjustifiable. Consequently, he (i) revised the conclusions he explicitly drew from the experimental evidence, (ii) rejected the idea that his spatial metaphysics was grounded in experimental evidence, and (iii) reassessed the epistemic status of key concepts in his metaphysics and natural philosophy. The narrative I explore shows not only that De Gravitatione did not constitute the metaphysical backdrop of the Principia as Newton ultimately understood it, but that it was the Principia itself that ultimately lead to the demise of key elements of De Gravitatione. I explore the implications of this narrative for Andrew Janiak’s and Howards Stein’s interpretations of Newton’s metaphysics.​",

    "abstract": "\"This book sets out for the first time in English and in the terms of modern logic the semantics of the Port Royal Logic (La Logique ou l’Art de penser, 1662-1685) of Antoine Arnauld and Pierre Nicole, perhaps the most influential logic book in the 17th and 18th centuries. Its goal is to explain how the Logic reworks the foundation of pre-Cartesian logic so as to make it compatible with Descartes’ metaphysics. The Logic’s authors forged a new theory of reference based on the medieval notion of objective being, which is essentially the modern notion of intentional content. Indeed, the book’s central aim is to detail how the Logic reoriented semantics so that it centered on the notion of intentional content. This content, which the Logic calls comprehension, consists of an idea’s defining modes. Mechanisms are defined in terms of comprehension that rework earlier explanations of central notions like conceptual inclusion, signification, abstraction, idea restriction, sensation, and most importantly within the Logic’s metatheory, the concept of idea-extension, which is a new technical concept coined by the Logic. Although Descartes is famous for rejecting \"Aristotelianism,\" he says virtually nothing about logic. His followers fill the gap. By putting to use the doctrine of objective being, which had been a relatively minor part of medieval logic, they preserve more central semantic doctrines, especially a correspondence theory of truth. A recurring theme of the book is the degree to which the Logic hews to medieval theory. This interpretation is at odds with what has become a standard reading among French scholars according to which this 16th-century work should be understood as rejecting earlier logic along with Aristotelian metaphysics, and as putting in its place structures more like those of 19th-century class theory\"–",

    "abstract": "The collaboration between laypeople and professional scientists known as “citizen science” is an important trend in research and data gathering. Citizen science offers important benefits to science and society. For example, citizens can help scientists with data collection and provide advice on research design and implementation. Citizens can also gain a better understanding of scientific concepts and methods. Additionally, citizens can help scientists better understand and address issues of concern to their families and communities. However, citizen science also raises ethical issues that should be addressed when projects begin and throughout the course of scientific investigation. To promote ethical research, scientists should develop guidelines for involvement of citizens in research, communicate effectively with participants and local communities at the outset of their involvement in research projects, carefully oversee their work, develop appropriate publication practices, and provide lay-volunteers with education and training on the responsible conduct of research. Researchers also need to be cognizant of clarifying these roles and responsibilities as well as promoting appropriate and safe citizen participation and transparency of the study methods, data analysis, and communication of results.",

    "abstract": "Citizen science is an increasingly popular activity, from bird counts to amateur water sample collection to air quality monitoring. Researchers and theorists in the field of science and technology studies (STS) have typically applauded these efforts because they make science more participatory, providing an example of the democratization of science, or, at least, more equitable engagement between experts and the lay public. However, a broader review of the literature on citizen science suggests that participation is but one of many virtues that practitioners and observers find in the practices of citizen science. This literature review makes two interventions. First, we discuss the dimensions of citizen science that do not easily fit in a typology or spectrum of participatory practices. We identify seven different virtues claimed of citizen science: increasing scientific data; increasing citizens’ scientific literacy and awareness; building community capacity for environmental protection; building more equal relationship between scientists and citizens; filling knowledge gaps and challenging official accounts; driving policy change; and catching polluters. Second, we consider the social and political contexts that often create contradictory situations or dilemmas for citizen scientists. Going forward, a robust framework for the analysis of citizen science would not only address the ways scientific data is collected and put to a particular use, but also situate the project in relation to broader structural forces of scientization, neocolonialism, globalization, and neoliberalization.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Deep learning is currently the most prominent and widely successful method in artificial intelligence. Despite having played an active role in earlier artificial intelligence and neural network research, philosophers have been largely silent on this technology so far. This is remarkable, given that deep learning neural networks have blown past predicted upper limits on artificial intelligence performance—recognizing complex objects in natural photographs and defeating world champions in strategy games as complex as Go and chess—yet there remains no universally accepted explanation as to why they work so well. This article provides an introduction to these networks as well as an opinionated guidebook on the philosophical significance of their structure and achievements. It argues that deep learning neural networks differ importantly in their structure and mathematical properties from the shallower neural networks that were the subject of so much philosophical reflection in the 1980s and 1990s. The article then explores several different explanations for their success and ends by proposing three areas of inquiry that would benefit from future engagement by philosophers of mind and science.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTNewton’s suggestion in Query 31 of the Opticks (1718) that infinite space is the sensorium of God and that God “is more able by his Will to move the Bodies within his boundless uniform Sensorium, and thereby to form and reform the Parts of the Universe, than we are by our Will to move the Parts of our own Bodies” has recently been shown to be both philosophically coherent and compatible with contemporary religious views. This paper explores the further meaning of this and what it tells us about Newton’s theology, and his attempts to maintain immanentism while avoiding pantheism. It is suggested that Newton’s evident equivocation in discussing these matters stems in large part from the fact that there was no designation in his day for his position, but it can now be understood as panentheism.",

William Harper’s excellent, difficult, and provocative book, winner of the 2014 Patrick Suppes Prize for Philosophy of Science, is by far the most detailed available account of Newton’s argument for universal gravitation in Book III of the Principia. It should be mandatory reading for philosophers interested in the relation of evidence to theory, as well as technically savvy historians of early modern physics. It should also be recommended to novices. Its chapters are mostly self-contained and its step-by-step approach make it a great companion for first time students of Newton’s System of the World.",

Philosophers interested in the impact of Newtonian science on the development of philosophy thus face the daunting task of teasing the historical truth from three centuries of elaborations and myths regarding Newton and his intellectual legacy. The current volume has the explicit dual goal of peeling away a number of prevailing misconceptions and introducing Newtonian science to a philosophical audience. In both regards, it is a success. The Companion is bound to become a standard reference work, and it is indispensable for scholars and newcomers interested in 17th and 18th century natural philosophy.",

The idea of embodiment is simple: to explain the behavior of bodies, we must understand them as unified wholes in their environments. Embodied approaches eschew explanations in terms of qualitative descriptions of the intrinsic properties of bodies and promote explanation in terms of the interaction between bodies. This idea can be found in Kepler’s optics, Descartes’ physics, and Newton’s physico-mathematics. The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems (Gibson, 1966) is the culmination of this centuries-long embodiment movement which can be traced back to the 17th century.",

    "abstract": "Although Galileo’s struggle to mathematize the study of nature is well known and oft discussed, less discussed is the form this struggle takes in relation to his first new science, the science of the second day of the Discorsi. I argue that Galileo’s first science ought to be understood as the science of matter—not, as it is usually understood, the science of the strength of materials. This formulation sheds light on the convoluted structure of the Discorsi’s first day. It suggests that the day’s meandering discussions of the continuum, infinity, the vacuum, and condensation and rarefaction establish that a formal treatment of the “eternal and necessary” properties of matter is possible; i.e., that matter as such can be considered mathematically. This would have been a necessary, and indeed revolutionary, preliminary to the mathematical science of the second day because matter itself was thought in the Aristotelian tradition to be responsible for the departure of natural bodies from the unchanging and thus mathematizable character of abstract objects. In addition, the first day establishes that when considered physically, these properties account for matter’s force of cohesion and resistance to fracture. This essay closes by showing that this dual style of reasoning accords with the conceptual structure of mixed mathematics.",

    "abstract": "​Accounts of Hobbes’s “system” of sciences oscillate between two extremes. On one extreme, the system is portrayed as wholly axiomatic-deductive, with state- craft being deduced in an unbroken chain from the principles of logic and rst philosophy. On the other, it is portrayed as rife with conceptual cracks and ssures, with Hobbes’s statements about its deductive structure amounting to mere window- dressing. This paper argues that a middle way is found by conceiving of Hobbes’s Elements of Philosophy on the model of a mixed-mathematical science, not the model provided by Euclid’s Elements of Geometry. I suggest that Hobbes is a test case for understanding early-modern system-construction more generally, as inspired by the structure of the applied mathematical sciences. This approach has the additional virtue of bolstering, in a novel way, the thesis that the transformation of philosophy in the long seventeenth century was heavily indebted to mathematics, a thesis that has increasingly come under attack in recent years.",

Newton was an able and subtle philosopher, working at a time when science was not yet recognized as an activity distinct from philosophy. He engaged with the work of Rene Descartes and G. W. Leibniz, and showed sensitivity to the work of John Locke, Francis Bacon, Pierre Gassendi, and Henry More, to name just a few. In his time, Newton was not perceived as a scientific outsider, but as an active and knowledgeable participant in philosophical debates.",

    "abstract": "Newton’s Regulae philosophandi — the rules for reasoning in natural philosophy — are maxims of causal reasoning and induction. This chapter reviews their significance for Newton’s method of inquiry, as well as their application to particular propositions within the Principia. Two main claims emerge. First, the rules are not only interrelated, they defend various facets of the same core idea: that nature is simple and orderly by divine decree, and that, consequently, human beings can be justified in inferring universal causes from limited phenomena, if only fallibly. Second, the rules make substantive ontological assumptions on which Newton’s argument in the Principia relies. Along the way, several standard interpretations of the rules are challenged.",

    "abstract": "Teaching Newtonian physics involves the replacementof students’ ideas about physical situations with precise conceptsappropriate for mathematical applications. This paper focuses on theconcepts of “matter” and “mass”. We suggest that students, likesome pre-Newtonian scientists we examine, use these terms in a waythat conflicts with their Newtonian meaning. Specifically, ‘matter’and “mass” indicate to them the sorts of things that are tangible,bulky, and take up space. In Newtonian mechanics, however, the termsare defined by Newton’s Second Law: “mass” is simply a measure ofthe acceleration generated by an impressed force. We examine therelationship between these conceptions as it was discussed by Newtonand his editor, Roger Cotes, when analyzing a series of pendulumexperiments. We suggest that these experiments, as well as moresophisticated computer simulations, can be used in the classroom tosufficiently differentiate the colloquial and precise meaning of theseterms.",

    "abstract": "Newton began his *Principia* with three Axiomata sive Leges Motus. We offer an interpretation of Newton’s dual label and investigate two tensions inherent in his account of laws. The first arises from the juxtaposition of Newton’s confidence in the certainty of his laws and his commitment to their variability and contingency. The second arises because Newton ascribes fundamental status both to the laws and to the bodies and forces they govern. We argue the first is resolvable, but the second is not. However, the second tension shows that Newton conceives laws as formal causes of bodies and forces. This neo-Aristotelian conception goes missing in Kantian accounts of laws, as well as accounts that stress laws’ grounding in powers and capacities.",

    "abstract": "Émilie Du Châtelet is well known for her French translation of Newton’s Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica. It is the first and only French translation of Newton’s magnum opus. The complete work appeared in 1759 under the title Principes mathématiques de la philosophie naturelle, par feue Madame la Marquise Du Chastellet. Before translating Newton’s Principia, Du Châtelet worked on her Institutions de physique. In this book she defended the Leibnizian concept of living forces – vis viva. This paper argues that both of these works were part of a critical transformation and consolidation of post-Newtonian mechanics in the early 18th century, beyond Newton and Leibniz. This will be shown by comparing Du Châtelet’s translation of Newton’s axioms with her own formulations of the laws of motion in light of Thomas Le Seur’s and François Jacquier’s Geneva edition which holds a special place among the several editions of the Principia that appeared in the early 18th century.",

It is argued that for polemical reasons the General Scholium, written twenty-six years after the first edition, substantially misrepresented the methodology of the main body of the text. The article discusses papers of Wallis, Wren and Huygens that use the third law of motion as set out by Newton in Book 1. It also argues that Newton’s use of induction is quite different from and subtler than the ’logical’ and ’probabilistic’ notions of induction discussed and then rejected by a number of twentieth-century philosophers.",

The remainder of the volume is devoted to philosophical reflections on qualities from the seventeenth century to the present day.

'Primary and Secondary Qualities' focuses on the age of the Scientific Revolution, the 'locus classicus' of the distinction, but begins with chapters on ancient Greek and Scholastic accounts of qualities in an effort to identify its origins. The remainder of the volume is devoted to philosophical reflections on qualities from the seventeenth century to the present day.

    "abstract": "\"The concept of gravity provides a natural phenomenon that is simultaneously obvious and obscure; we all know what it is, but rarely question why it is. The simple observation that ’what goes up must come down’ contrasts starkly with our current scientific explanation of gravity, which involves challenging and sometimes counterintuitive concepts. With such extremes between the plain and the perplexing, gravity forces a sharp focus on scientific method. Following the history of gravity from Aristotle to Einstein, this clear account highlights the logic of scientific method for non-specialists. Successive theories of gravity and the evidence for each are presented clearly and rationally, focusing on the fundamental ideas behind them. Using only high-school level algebra and geometry, the author emphasizes what the equations mean rather than how they are derived, making this accessible for all those curious about gravity and how science really works\"–",

    "abstract": "The correspondence in 1680 and 1681 between John Flamsteed and Isaac Newton on Flamsteed’s theory of the comet of 1680 tells half the story. Related manuscripts reveal Newton was pursuing his own comprehensive line of inquiry based on principles that were the antithesis of Flamsteed’s procedures. Following generally accepted views in England, Newton’s work was marked by critical evaluation of data but marred by uncritical use of simple calculating techniques based on what might be termed Platonic archetypes of straightness. Flamsteed’s intervention provided useful data and allowed Newton to seek additional information. Although Newton supposedly briefly considered a solution that vaguely resembled his parabolic approximation of the path of the comet determined 5 years later, the evidence Newton provided (based on simple hypotheses) did not support such a highly curved path or one in which the sun apart from the solar vortex exerted influence. Newton’s work, including an alleged harmonic law of tails, was quietly abandoned in favor of other work. With new insight, Newton revived work on comets as fully gravitational objects immediately following Halley’s visit in 1684. This little known side of the episode provides a fresh opportunity to examine Newton’s sources and actual practice in developing a new line of inquiry. An appendix dating sections of Newton’s Waste Book entries on comets is included.",

    "abstract": "This article examines Newton’s method of induction and its connection to methodological atomism. The article argues that Newton’s Rule III for the Study of Natural Philosophy is a criterion for isolating the primary qualities of the atomic parts; in other words, it interprets Rule III as a transductive inference. It is shown that both the standard inductive and invariance interpretations of Rule III can be subsumed under the transductive view, although the invariance criterion is reinterpreted; by qualities “that cannot be intended or remitted,” Newton means qualities that are invariant under changes in the configuration of the atomic parts.",

    "abstract": "Despite what you have heard over the years, the famous evil deceiver argument in Meditation One is not original to Descartes (1596–1650). Early modern meditators often struggle with deceptive demons. The author of the Meditations (1641) is merely giving a new spin to a common rhetorical device. Equally surprising is the fact that Descartes’ epistemological rendering of the demon trope is probably inspired by a Spanish nun, Teresa of Ávila (1515–1582), whose works have been ignored by historians of philosophy, although they were a global phenomenon during Descartes’ formative years. In this paper, I first answer the obvious question as to why previous early modernists have missed something so important as the fact that Descartes’ most famous publication relies on a well-established genre and that his deceiver argument bears a striking similarity to ideas in Teresa’s final work, El Castillo Interior (Interior Castle, 1588)? I discuss the meditative tradition at the end of which Descartes’ Meditations stands, present evidence to support the claim that Descartes was familiar with Teresa’s proposals, contrast their meditative goals, and make a point-by-point comparison between the meditative steps in Teresa’s Interior Castle and those in Descartes’ Meditations which constitute (what I call) their common deceiver strategy. My conclusion makes a case for a broader and more inclusive history of philosophy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this paper, I compare theory-laden perceptions with imputed data sets. The similarities between the two allow me to show how the phenomenon of theory-ladenness can manifest itself in statistical analyses. More importantly, elucidating the differences between them will allow me to broaden the focus of the existing literature on theory-ladenness and to introduce some much-needed nuances. The topic of statistical imputation has received no attention in philosophy of science. Yet, imputed data sets are very similar to theory-laden perceptions, and they are now an integral part of many scientific inferences. Unlike the existence of theory-laden perceptions, that of imputed data sets cannot be challenged or reduced to a manageable source of error. In fact, imputed data sets are created purposefully in order to improve the quality of our inferences. They do not undermine the possibility of scientific knowledge; on the contrary, they are epistemically desirable.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Like many virtuosi in his day, the English philosopher John Locke maintained an active interest in metrology. Yet for Locke, this was no mere hobby: questions concerning measurement were also implicated in his ongoing philosophical project to develop an account of human understanding. This paper follows Locke’s treatment of four problems of measurement from the early Drafts A and B of the Essay concerning Human Understanding to the publication of this famous book and its aftermath. It traces Locke’s attempt to develop a natural or universal standard for the measure of length, his attempts to grapple with the measurement of duration, as well as the problems of determining comparative measures for secondary qualities, and the problem of discriminating small differences in the conventional measures of his day. It is argued that the salient context for Locke’s treatment of these problems is the new experimental philosophy and its method of experimental natural history.",

    "abstract": "In the past decade, several Descartes scholars have gone on record claiming that, for biological purposes, Descartes likely accepts the practical scientific necessity of the existence of “physical natures,” even while his official substance-mode ontology and his characterization of matter in terms of extension do not license the existence of physical natures. In this article, I elaborate on the historical context of Descartes’s biology, the “practical scientific necessity” just mentioned, and argue, contrary to other interpretations, that Descartes does offer a philosophical justification for the existence of physical natures, albeit not by appeal to the categories of substance and mode, or matter as such, but by appeal to our “nature” as a union between mind and body.",

    "abstract": "On December 13, 1679 Newton sent a letter to Hooke on orbital motion for central forces, which contains a drawing showing an orbit for a constant value of the force. This letter is of great importance, because it reveals the state of Newton’s development of dynamics at that time. Since the first publication of this letter in 1929, Newton’s method of constructing this orbit has remained a puzzle particularly because he apparently made a considerable error in the angle between successive apogees of this orbit. In fact, it is shown here that Newton’s implicit computation of this orbit is quite good, and that the error in the angle is due mainly to an error of drawing in joining two segments of the oribit, which Newton related by a reflection symmetry. In addition, in the letter Newton describes quite correctly the geometrical nature of orbits under the action of central forces (accelerations) which increase with decreasing distance from the center. An iterative computational method to evaluate orbits for central forces is described, which is based on Newton’s mathematical development of the concept of curvature started in 1664. This method accounts very well for the orbit obtained by Newton for a constant central force, and it gives convergent results even for forces which diverge at the center, which are discussed correctly in Newton’s letter without using Kepler’s law of areas. Newton found the relation of this law to general central forces only after his correspondence with Hooke. The curvature method leads to an equation of motion which Newton could have solved analytically to find that motion on a conic section with a radial force directed towards a focus implies an inverse square force, and that motion on a logarithmic spiral implies an inverse cube force.",

    "annote": "The image of the tree of knowledge seems revolutionary at first: where is theology? where is mathematics? why are mechanics, medicine and morality “principal” sciences?\nDescartes tree does not follow the order of discovery (<i>ordo cognoscendi</i>), or an order for philosophizing. In the preface to the <i>Priniciples</i>, he gives a different order a different order than the one embodied in the tree. The order followed is the order of being (<i>ordo essendi</i>), i.e., metaphysics provides the foundations for physics, physics the foundation for medicine and morality (Ariew does not mention mechanics here, why?). This order was rejected by the Encyclopedists of the 18th century: they held that any order is necessary arbitrary and chose to use an order inspired by Bacon’s division of sciences according to the faculties of the human mind (Ariew uses many of the texts I’ve been looking it, particularly D’Alembert and Diderot. DAMN IT). They considered Descartes to be part of the “old” way of classification. Ariew notes what seems to be the main problem: how are physics related to morality and medicine? Aren’t they about different sorts of object (physics about intellectual objects, the remainder about mind/body unions)?\nHe writes: “we will concentrate on the classification of the sciences as it would have been understood by Descartes’ immediate predecessors and contemporaries, the Jesuits, those scholars who influenced Descartes and Descartes’ teacher at La Fleche. Jesuits themselves were not always a wholly harmonious group, but, from 1586 onward, they attempted to put forward roughly the same doctrine in their teaching. (p. 106)”. Ariew notes the medieval discussions are vast, cites Aristotle’s main passages and Weishepl. “For a Jesuit, the key question concerned the utility of mathematics to natural philosophy and the status of such mathematical sciences as astronomy and optics. Ariew sources of Jesuit discussion is mainly Ludovico Carbone’s <i>Introductio in Universam philosophiam</i>, a section titled <i>Dubitationes quaedam circa scientias mathematicas</i>, discussed in (<b>Wall84?</b>), although Carbone is not a Jesuit. He also cites Benito Pereira and Alessandro Piccolomini, both discussed in (<b>Crom77?</b>)..Carbone’s view “fits very well” other 16th cent doctrines of Thomist descent (on Aquinas seminal role here, see (<b>Dear87?</b>)). . Brief rundown of the view, with a paragraph rife with some of the usual ambiguities. “It is against this view that Christopher Clavius proposed his reform of mathematics”. Good quotes from Clavius, some of the most famous ones. Ariew believes that Clavius and Carbone do not really represent different views, but offer “a difference of emphasis with in the same general theory”. I’m not sure this is completely fair.\nAriew consider the “radical variant” in the tradition of classification offered by Grosseteste and Roger Bacon, which holds a primary place for mathematics (again, the passage is ambigous in the usual ways, and very short). IMPORTANTLY, Ariew notes that this tradition was not represented in the Jesuit debates, and was not likely known by Descartes (see p. 110, ft. 9).\np. 110–2 is the heart, Ariew details Descartes self-conception as a mixed-mathematician. AND: “Unlike the Thomists and the Jesuits who think about the sciences as different disciplines with separate subjects, Descartes attempts to extend his successes in mathematics and the middle sciences into all of philosophy.” However, the bottom line is that “Descartes’ talk of unification adn classification does not seem consistent” (p.113). He then point to a change in strategy before and after the rules, with reference to (<b>Kraus83?</b>) and (<b>Marion81?</b>).",

    "annote": "Belkind argues that he is offering a more nuanced reading that LaSalle and Ryno on the scholium (against the inference to the best explanation school).The argument is based on the idea that quantity of motion is measured with respect to moving places (understood as moving volumes). Without an immovable space, determination of quantity of motions (which is taken to be unique) are prey to an infinite regress. Belkind argues that such a determination is forced by the idea that the motion of the whole is constituted from the motion of the parts. [I don’t quite get how this works.]Belkind also argues that space must be acausal for this story to work. I think this is clearly false. He claims that if the absolute space can carry momentum, then determination of the quantity of motion would be impossible. But his argument only requires that absolute space have zero momentum, not that is it not possible for it to have the property of momentum-carrying at all.",

    "abstract": "Abstract  Adriaan van Roomen published an outline of what he called a Mathesis Universalis in 1597. This earned him a well-deserved place in the history of early modern ideas about a universal mathematics which was intended to encompass both geometry and arithmetic and to provide general rules valid for operations involving numbers, geometrical magnitudes, and all other quantities amenable to measurement and calculation. “Mathesis Universalis” (MU) became the most common (though not the only) term for mathematical theories developed with that aim. At some time around 1600 van Roomen composed a new version of his MU, considerably different from the earlier one. This second version was never effectively published and it has not been discussed in detail in the secondary literature before. The text has, however, survived and the two versions are presented and compared in the present article. Sections 1–6 are about the first version of van Roomen’s MU the occasion of its publication (a controversy about Archimedes’ treatise on the circle, Sect. 2), its conceptual context (Sect. 3), its structure (with an overview of its definitions, axioms, and theorems) and its dependence on Clavius’ use of numbers in dealing with both rational and irrational ratios (Sect. 4), the geometrical interpretation of arithmetical operations multiplication and division (Sect. 5), and an analysis of its content in modern terms. In his second version of a MU van Roomen took algebra into account, inspired by Viète’s early treatises; he planned to publish it as part of a new edition of Al-Khwarizmi’s treatise on algebra (Sect. 7). Section 8 describes the conceptual background and the difficulties involved in the merging of algebra and geometry; Sect. 9 summarizes and analyzes the definitions, axioms and theorems of the second version, noting the differences with the first version and tracing the influence of Viète. Section 10 deals with the influence of van Roomen on later discussions of MU, and briefly sketches Descartes’ ideas about MU as expressed in the latter’s Regulae.",

    "abstract": "Aristotelianism remained the dominant influence on the course of natural philosophy taught at the University of Paris until the 1690s, when it was swiftly replaced by Cartesianism. The change was not one wanted by church or state and can only be understood by developments within the wider University. On the one hand, the opening of a new college, the Collège de Mazarin, provided an environment in which the mechanical philosophy could flourish. On the other, divisions within the French Catholic Church between Augustinians and Molinists led to Cartesianism finding support within an important section of the faculty of theology, which was the traditional guardian of philosophical orthodoxy. The conversion of the University of Paris to Cartesianism had important consequences. It encouraged similar changes to the natural philosophical curriculum throughout France and affected the structure and raison d’être of the Académie des Sciences.",

    "abstract": "In Descartes&rsquo;s reformulation of natural philosophy, two aspects of what came to be known as the mechanical philosophy were intimately joined: mechanism as an ontology of nature, according to which all natural things had only &lsquo;mechanical&rsquo; properties; and mechanism as a method of explanation. One could, and many philosophers did, adopt mechanism as a method of explanation without adopting a mechanistic ontology. I examine two successors of Descartes who did just that, and one who did not. Giovanni Alfonso Borelli in his <i>De motu animalium</i> (1680) and Charles Perrault in his <i>M&eacute;canique de animaux</i> (1680&ndash;1688, Vol. 3) propose and argue for a variety of mechanical accounts of the operations of animals, in particular of their muscles. They reject, however, the Cartesian reduction of animal souls to mechanical forces; the principle of animal motion for them remains a non-mechanical soul. Pierre Sylvain R&eacute;gis in his <i>Cours entier de philosophie</i> (1690, 1691) follows Descartes in taking the &lsquo;physical cause&rsquo; of motion in animals to be the fermentation of blood in the heart, and thus denies animal souls any role in his physiology. That he can do so while taking over, sometimes word for word, Perrault&rsquo;s accounts of animal motion shows that mechanistic explanation and mechanistic ontology could easily part company.",

Firstly, in common with most other philosophers of his generation, it appears that Popper had very little acquaintance with the contents and methodological complexities of <i>Principia</i> beyond what was in the famous General Scholium. Secondly Popper&rsquo;s ideas about induction were less sophisticated than those of Newton, who recognised that it did not provide logical proofs of the results obtained using it, because of the possibilities of later, contrary evidence. I also trace the historical background to commonplace misconceptions about Newton&rsquo;s method.",

Locke presents corpuscularinism as a mere hypothesis, but his explication of the metaphysical aspects of this epistemology—e.g., the primary/Secondary distinction, the notion of real essense—seems to depend on it. What gives? The essay is a detailed study of some of Locke’s most famous remarks about the primary/Secondary distinction. By ’mechanism’, Downing only means the appeal to certain privileged qualities. The upshot: “Corpuscularianism is a <i>uniquely natural</i> theory [not infallible, but better than virtually all others] for human beings because it postulates that the real essence of body corresponds precisely to the nominal essence of body that we distill from pre-theoretic reflection on ordinary sensory experience (p.403)”. Downing final position is that Corpuscularianism is an illustration, but a uniquely natural one, of Locke’s larger metaphysical and epistemological views; it is also the best game in town.",

In the essay at hand, I shall argue that this text served a variety of goals and try to add something new to our current knowledge of how Newton tried to accomplish them. The General Scholium highlights a cornucopia of features that were central to Newton?s natural philosophy in general: matters of experimentation, methodological issues, theological matters, matters related to the instauration of prisca sapientia, epistemological claims central to Newton?s empiricism, and, finally, metaphysical issues. For Newton these matters were closely interwoven. I shall address these matters based on a thorough study of the extant manuscript material.",

    "abstract": "Newton’s ’Principia ’introduced conceptions of space and time that launched one of the most famous and sustained debates in the history of physics, a controversy that involves fundamental concerns in the foundations of physics, metaphysics, and scientific epistemology.This book introduces and clarifies the historical and philosophical development of the clash between Newton’s absolute conception of space and Leibniz’s relational one. It separates the issues and provides new perspectives on absolute relational accounts of motion and relational-substantival accounts of the ontology of space time.Earman’s sustained treatment and imaginative insights raise to a new level the debate on these important issues at the boundary of philosophy and physics. He surveys the history of the controversy from Newton to Einstein develops the mathematics and physics needed to pose the issues in sharp form and provides a persuasive assessment of the philosophical problems involved.Most importantly, Earman revitalizes the connection of the debate to contemporary science. He shows, for example, how concerns raised by Leibniz form the core of ongoing debate on the foundations of general theory of relativity, moving the discussion into a new and vital arena and introducing arguments that will be discussed for years to come.John Earman is Professor of History and Philosophy of Science at the University of Pittsburgh.

In this concise exploration of the significance of the celestial world for Aristotle’s science of nature, Falcon investigates the source of discontinuity between celestial and sublunary natures and argues that the conviction that the natural world exhibits unity without uniformity is the ultimate reason for Aristotle’s claim that the heavens are made of a special body, unique to them. This book presents Aristotle as a totally engaged, systematic investigator whose ultimate concern was to integrate his distinct investigations into a coherent interpretation of the world we live in, all the while mindful of human limitations to what can be known. Falcon reads in Aristotle the ambition of an extraordinarily curious mind and the confidence that that ambition has been largely fulfilled.",

    "annote": "This paper attempts to draw attention to non-conventional but popular modes of transmitting scientific knowledge in Jesuit institutions in the 17th century. The particular case study focuses on a fictive dialogue between Galileo, Mersenne and Paulus Guldin on the power needed for moving the huge globe of the earth by mechanical means. The dialogue was written by a Jesuit mathematician named Paolo Casati (1617–1707) and published in 1655. Apparently, Casati offers his readers an idealized representation of a real event that took place at the Collegio Romano, where explanation of mathematical problems in a kind of public ritual used to take place once or twice a month in presence of philosophers, theologians, visitors and students. My analysis of some parts of Casati’s Terra Machinis Mota exemplifies the Jesuits’ success to accommodate the project of Renaissance practical mathematicians – the fusion of the pseudo-Aristotelian interest in machines with the mathematical approach of Archimedes – to the framework of the traditional mixed mathematical science that legitimized it and spread it among wide audiences. Casati’s text demonstrates how at least some Jesuit mathematicians were ready to adopt Galileo’s early mechanical project. However, moving from an analysis of the contents of mechanical knowledge popularized in this text to its analysis on the rhetorical level reveals the unbearable tensions by which Jesuit scientific culture was actually torn. The rhetorical choice to construct a representation of a seemingly friendly dialogue between the quasi-heretic Galileo, the Minim friar Mersenne and the suspected character of the Jesuit Guldin reveals the strategies by which Galileo’s heretic image was tamed in order to fit the Jesuits’ needs to construct themselves an enlightened public image.GOOD QUOTE on mixed mathematic in first paragraph.",

Basically Finocchiaro has made an excellent compilation of all documents pertaining the famous ’Galileo Affair’, of what happened in the Inquisition’s case against Galileo.But more than that, Finocchiaro in his ’Introduction’ to the book, deals with both sides of the affair, of those against Galileo, and of those in his favor. He then tries to make a very accurate interpretation about what really happened them, and pointing to both groups’ flaws about their interpretation of history. Certainly the Galileo Affair was not just a case where the Inquisition was absolutely right, but also it is far beyond the statement that the Inquisition wanted him silenced to prevent the advance of science. The Galileo Affair is much more complex than that, and Finnochiaro takes into account the scientific, philosophical, theological and political realities of the time.The documents in the book include correspondence, Inquisition documents, fragments of Galileo’s writings, among others. You MUST have this book if you want to understand more accurately the Galileo Affair.",

This book argues that no metaphysical account of laws can succeed. The author analyses and rejects the arguments that there are laws of nature, or that we must believe that there are. He argues that we should discard the idea of law as an inadequate clue to science. After exploring what this means for general epistemology, the book develops the empiricist view of science as a construction of models to represent the phenomena. Concepts of symmetry, transformation, and invariance illuminate the structure of such models. A central role is played in science by symmetry arguments, and it is shown how these function also in the philosophical analysis of probability. The advocated approach presupposes no realism about laws or necessities in nature.",

    "abstract": "On the basis of evidence drawn from the Waste book, Westfall and Nicholas have argued that Newton arrived at his second law of motion by reflecting on the implications of the first law. I analyze another argument in the Waste book which reveals that Newton also arrived at the second law by another very different route. On this route, it is the consideration of the third law and the principle of conservation of motion—and not the first law—that prompts Newton to formulate the second law. The existence of these two routes is significant because each employs a distinct kind of reasoning about forces. Whereas the Nicholas–Westfall route via the principle of inertia bears the mark of Descartes’s influence, the alternative route proceeds from the action–reaction principle, which is widely regarded as an original Newtonian contribution to mechanics. In the course of exploring this alternate route to the second law, the origins and justification of the third law are examined.",

    "annote": "B1875 .D38 Garber wants to replace the model of cartesian science as a geometrical science with something more complicated. The cause of seeking a replacement is that there is sufficiently strong evidence that Descartes endorsed, at some points, either a full blown HD method, or at least accepted some constraints to the claim that his science held the sort of certainty which was reserved for the mathematical sciences. This is due to the fact that he seems to accept that experiment are necessary for the construction of a science.Part of Garber’s argument is that \"While we shall find a somewhat different situation when we examine the Principles, I shall maintain that in the works we are considering [pre-Principles], Descarte has neither adopted any hypothetical mode of argument, nor has he given up his plain for a certain science, and that, furthermore, this certain science is one in which experiment lays an indispensable role.\" (p.130).Garber believes that in the early writings Descartes treats the HD method as a method of presentation. That is, he belives that all his claims *can be* deduced in a purely geometrical manner, but for brevity and for the sake of not exposing his principles to the public, he chooses the method of hypothesis.Garber also holds that we should not understand DEscartes’ appeal to the method of hypothesis as a rejection of he goal of certainty. He notes that Descartes never explicitly asserts,even when asserting the many explanation are possible for a single phenomena, etc., that certainty is not possbile for the phenomena. Descartes can hold on to certainty by means of the crucial experiment.",

    "annote": "QC6 .G25 1992Chap 9: God and the Grounds of the Laws of MotionGod concourse sustains the duration of created thing, this duration being merely a distinction of reason from their existence Pr I. 62. God’s continual sustenance is considered the efficient cause, but a causa secundum esse; a cause of being, while all efficient causes that are created things are causae secundom fieri. This view was borrowed from Aquinas summa.Duration: the quesiton of whether God conserves in partless atoms of time or in extended moments of duration is irrelevant, Garber argues. Both views can be resonably attributed to Descartes.The laws of nature are not“imposed\" by Gods (as Leibniz’s God imposes laws), rather, they follows from the way God acts in the world (p.274). Garber also argues that since Descartes rejects substantial forms, he cannot endorse Aquinas’ picture of God as the primary cause of everything, but forms being the secondary causes responsible for sustanining particular thing. He writes that“What Descartes chooses in their place is God, who will act not only as the general conservator of the world, but as the direct cause of motion and change in that world (275).This picture may suggest the“cinematic view\". That God causes motion by creating material bodies in different configurations. Garber suggests that this may have been Descartes’ view Le Monde and the Principles, but a different picture emerges in the letter to More (Aug. 1949). In order to understand this picture, we need to consider the picture that Descartes is trying to replace. The picture he is replacing is of substantial forms (Aquinas’ secondary causes) causing motions. How does motion come about in this picture? Garber holds that—according to Descartes—forms cause motion by being“modal cause\", they can change the modes of bodies, but nothing more. God is a“substantial cause\" because he can bring about the existence of the substance that have particular attributes and modes.But there is a problem from this view. What about Rest? Isn’t it equivalent to Rest? Garber’s answer involves appeal to the resistive force of rest. Seems tenuous.The derivation of the laws of motion starts with God’s constancy of action. Garber sees here evidence for the“divine shove\" view, since on the cinematic view it is unclear why there should be motion at all. I can buy this....“What is important is that God, having created an impulsion that causes motion in bodies, sustains that impulsion, whether it be in hinm or in one of his creatures\". The divine shove also explains why God sustains motion and not other numerical features of body (like number of triangles), since the creation of motion is unique.detailed discussion of how God’s immutability underwrites the laws. Interestingly, the laws of collision has a weird status, some of it is not justified, particularly the collision model on which it is based.Concerning force, Garber suggest the we reject Hatfield’s, Gueroult’s, and Gabbey’s position, in favor a force-as-epiphenomenal conception. Force is“nowhere\" in Descartes’ universe, but merely a way to describe bodies that are moving in accordance to the laws of motion.",

    "annote": "I shall argue that... Descartes profoundly transformed not only natural philosophy but mechanics as well, and that the new mechanical philosophy represented a rupture not only with Aristotelian natural philosophy but, in a way, with the science of mechanics as well. At the same time, I shall, it was the connection between mechanics and the new mechanical philosophy that allowed Descartes’ new science to remain intelligible to the adherents of the Aristotelian tradition he rejects and inteded to replace. p. 186.\nWhat is a machine? Something that achieves human goals. Embedded in this conception of the domain of mechanics was a certain conception of the natural world, the distinction between the natural and the artificial, and a certain related conception of the relations between the science of physics and the science of mechanics (p.188).\nAquinas discusses the middle science in commentrary on De Trinitate q5a3ad6; In II Phys. lect. 3, n. 8; Summa Theol. 2–2.9.2 ad 3.\nDescartes talk about mechanics in two senses: one is FOUNDATIONAL: mechanics becomes the epistemological route to the whole of physics, and the laws of physics are just the laws of mechanics. The other is NON-FOUNDATIONAL: mechanics is the fruit of a science of physics, and is a proper part of it. At the same time, when Descartes says that he is doing mechanics, it does not look like any 16th century text on mechanics. There are no simple machines. More importantly, there is no heaviness, which all previous mechanicians assume. When Descartes does Galilean style mechanics, he assumes heaviness, but is explicitly unhappy about it.\nImportantly, Descartes does not believe machines have innate purposes. We imposed telos on machine, but in themselves they are just collections of parts. This is a departure from traditional mechanics, on which machines, artificial constructions, have purposes. Descartes brings the natural and artificial together by considering God as the creator of nature. But at the end of the day, the reference to God drops out, and natural items do not have purposes.\nThis is not a radical break with aristotelinism, since mechanics was thought to be compatible with aristotelian philosophy.",

    "abstract": "Newton’s experiments into the resistance which fluids offer to moving bodies provide some insight into the way he related theory and experiment. His theory demonstrates a way of thought typical of 17th century physics and his experiments are simple enough to be replicated by present day students. Newton’s investigations using pendulums were discussed in a previous paper. In this paper Newton’s theory of the resisted motion of falling bodies is outlined, his investigations into the resistance offered to falling bodies by water and the experiments of others into the resistance offered by air are described and some implications for teaching about the nature of science are discussed.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a detailed account of Descartes’ derivation of his second law of nature—the law of rectilinear motion—from a priori metaphysical principles. Unlike the other laws the proof of the second depends essentially on a metaphysical assumption about the temporal immediacy of God’s operation. Recent commentators (e.g., Des Chene and Garber) have not adequately ex- plained the precise role of this assumption in the proof and Descartes’ reason- ing has continued to seem somewhat arbitrary as a result. My account better reveals the dependence of the second law on fundamental principles about time and causality.",
    "annote": "The second law, unlike the other laws, depends on an assumption regarding the temporal immediacy of God’s operation, not just His immutability. By revealing this assumption, Gorham hopes to demonstrate \"the unity of Descartes’ metaphysics and natural philosophy\" (p. 433). The argument is that according to Garber and Des Chene, the argument for the second law appear in some ways arbitrary: by revealing its connection to premises about time and causality, Gorham shows that it is connected to metaphysical principles, as it is supposed to be.2. Proof of Rectilinear Motion: The seonc dlaw is that all motion is in itself rectilinear. According to Gorham, what this demands is thatall times a rectilinear “tendency”tendency (or inclination or action). Unlike actual motion, tendency is an instantaneous state of bodies which may or may not give rise to actual motion over time. This interpretation of Law II relies on a distinction between proper tendency and overall tendency. The overall tendency of a body will always be to continue in the actual path in which it continues: it is moving in a circle, its tendency is to move in a circle. However, its proper tendency is to move in a straight line, it is the tendency that is due to the body itself.But directionality is a feature of determination, not overall tendency. Gorham shows that determination can have instantaneous states. what the second law of nature more precisely postulates is that the determination of the proper tendency of each part of a moving body is always along a straight line.3. Gorham considers Des Chene and Garber on the proof.",

    "abstract": "Newton’s methodology is significantly richer than the hypothetico‐deductive model. It is informed by a richer ideal of empirical success that requires not just accurate prediction but also accurate measurement of parameters by the predicted phenomena. It accepts theory‐mediated measurements and theoretical propositions as guides to research. All of these enrichments are exemplified in the classical response to Mercury’s perihelion problem. Contrary to Kuhn, Newton’s method endorses the radical transition from his theory to Einstein’s. The richer themes of Newton’s method are strikingly realized in a challenge to general relativity from a new problem posed by Mercury’s perihelion.",

Hatfield argues that Rorty’s accounts of Descartes’s and Locke’s philosophical work are seriously flawed. Rorty misunderstood the participation of early modern philosophers in the rise of modern science, and he misdescribed their examination of cognition as psychological rather than epistemological. His diagnostic efforts were thereby undermined, and he missed Descartes’s original conception of a general physics, and Locke’s probabilist analysis of the grounds for rational belief.",

    "annote": "The problem is why, if Descartes physics is deduced a priori from his metaphysics, does he appeal to empirical evidence, an a posteriori arguement, in order to defend it. First a comparison to Scholastics: in the scholastic tradition, metaphysics was distinguished from physics by the degree of abbstraction from ordinary experience. Metaphysics had nothing in particular to offer physics, since besides general concents (substance/accident, etc.), the physician had to study particular forms, forms that the metaphysician had no particular access to. Descartes is different from the scholastic on this count: he believes that metaphysics has something to teach the physicist. However, the particulars of his system are also different. He had made a ’housecleaning’ of the scholastic system, reducing the number of forms, possible explanations, etc. How does he defend this system?Descartes has 2 ways of defending his system: one a priori and one a posteriori. The a priori way is to claim that the substantial form of the scholastics are unintelligible on epistemological grounds. Hatfield writes:“the metaphysical justification of the fundamental principles of his physics depended upon a novel conception of metaphysical knowledge — one that bases such knowledge on pure rational intuition as opposed to abstraction from sensory particulars — as developmed in his Meditations on First Philosophy. p. 154. The a posteriori way was based on an “empirical”empirical criterion of explanatory adequacy.What is the motivation for each method of explanation? Hatfield notes that the“distinctive role of metaphysics, then, is to establish as certainly as possile what could be claimed as merely empirically plausible if left to its own, a poteriori, devices.\" p. 156. The two, then, work in tandem.Hatfield then stresses than according to a scholastic conception of science as demonstrative, this would not makes sense. He claims that Descartes aimed to change the very ideal of science in order to make his particular version of science more plausible.... Then a discussion about the circle of causes, effect, proof and demonstration and the way Descartes interpreted these terms.Useful introductory essay to these problem.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article responds to Professor Andrew Janiak’s recent attempt to defend the proposition that Isaac Newton did not believe in action at a distance between bodies (or any other kind of substance) (Janiak, 2013). His argument rests on a distinction between “three concepts of causation in Newton”, which leads him to conclude that although Newton did not believe in action at a distance between bodies, he was able to accept that gravity was a “distant action”. I critically examine Janiak’s arguments here, and the historical evidence he brings to bear upon it, and argue that Professor Janiak’s latest claims do nothing to undermine the view to which he is opposed, namely, that Newton did believe in the possibility of action at a distance between bodies.",

This paper details Euler&rsquo;s treatment of the <i>vis viva</i> problem. Within those details we find differences between his physics and that of Newton, in particular the rejection of empty space and reduction of all forces to the operation of inertia through contact. One can further see how Euler&rsquo;s philosophy of science embraced explanation through mechanisms and equilibrium conditions.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, I argue that recent debates about Newton’s attitude toward action at a distance have been hampered by a lack of conceptual clarity. To clarify the metaphysical background of the debates, I distinguish three kinds of causes within Newton’s work: mechanical, dynamical, and substantial causes. This threefold distinction enables us to recognize that although Newton clearly regards gravity as an impressed force that operates across vast distances, he denies that this commitment requires him to think that some substance acts at a distance on another substance. (Dynamical causation is distinct from substantial causation.) Newton’s denial of substantial action at a distance may strike his interpreters as questionable, so I provide an argument to show that it is in fact acceptable.",

With a scathing rebuttal to Hobbes’s claims, the mathematician John Wallis began one of the longest and most intense intellectual disputes of all time. ’Squaring the Circle’ is a detailed account of this controversy, from the core mathematics to the broader philosophical, political, and religious issues at stake.Hobbes believed that by recasting geometry in a materialist mold, he could solve any geometric problem and thereby demonstrate the power of his materialist metaphysics. Wallis, a prominent Presbyterian divine as well as an eminent mathematician, refuted Hobbes’s geometry as a means of discrediting his philosophy, which Wallis saw as a dangerous mix of atheism and pernicious political theory.Hobbes and Wallis’s ’battle of the books’ illuminates the intimate relationship between science and crucial seventeenth-century debates over the limits of sovereign power and the existence of God.",

    "abstract": "Denis Kambouchner Les Méditations métaphysiques de DescartesDenis Kambouchner, Les Méditations métaphysiques de Descartes, Presses Universitaires de France, 2005, 415pp, 19€ (pbk), ISBN 2130516254.Reviewed by Steven Nadler, University of Wisconsin-MadisonOne could easily be forgiven for thinking that we have more than enough books on Descartes’s Meditations, particularly those that take the meditation-by-meditation approach and walk us slowly through the theses and arguments of the work. And yet, with his new book, the first in a projected series of three volumes and devoted primarily to the First Meditation, Denis Kambouchner adds a significant new study to this most-studied of early modern philosophical treatises.Kambouchner takes his time in approaching the text itself and the particular arguments of the First Meditation. Rather, the first half of the book is devoted to discussion of more general themes, including the historical and philosophical context of the Meditations. Kambouchner looks closely at questions related to the work’s substance and style, and considers its purpose, its method, and its audience. He examines the development of the meditation form as devotional testimony and literary technique, and provides a subtle reading of the way in which Descartes employs that form for his own philosophical purposes. He notes the differences and the similarities with antecedents in Augustine and Anselm (with whose spiritual exercises Kambouchner assimilates, to some degree, Descartes’s first-person \"analytic\" – as opposed to \"synthetic\" – undertaking) and other religious authors. He also, in these opening chapters, lays out a persuasive case for the unity of the Meditations and the Objections/Replies, showing how both are equally essential elements in the presentation of Descartes’s metaphysical project, albeit without undermining the independence of the text of the six meditations itself.Above all, Kambouchner’s \"Introduction Générale\" offers an insightful reconstruction of the context of metaphysics in the pre-Cartesian world and examines the various and often competing senses of ’metaphysics’ employed therein (science of being, science of God, etc.). Kambouchner wants to persuade us that, rather than thinking in terms of a \"Cartesian revolution\" in philosophy, we should look at Descartes as offering a \"reinvention of metaphysics\", one that can be understood only in the light of late medieval developments. This, he insists, somewhat paradoxically but with perfect justification, will give us a better sense of Descartes’s originality. Suarez is an important character in this story, for, according to Kambouchner, it was he who simplified and generalized metaphysics into the study of \"being insofar as it is real being\", including among its objects infinite being, that is, God, and thus making theology a subset of metaphysical inquiry.For Descartes, in Kambouchner’s view, metaphysics is not the science of being qua being, but rather the accomplishment of a particular foundational task through the methodical treatment of certain immaterial and thus metaphysical objects (especially God and the human soul, including the principles of knowledge). In this regard, there is no distinction, for Descartes, between metaphysics and first philosophy. To the question so often asked by recent French scholars, \"Is Descartes truly a metaphysician?\" or \"Does Descartes belong to the history of metaphysics?\", Kambouchner answers with a definite ’yes’, but not by showing how Descartes is doing metaphysics in the Scholastic sense of the term. \"La métaphysique de Descartes pourra donc bien n’être pas de la meme espèce que celle de l’École . . . mais si l’on convient d’appeler ’métaphysique’ la demarche d’un esprit qui sait atteindre, comme dira Leibniz, au \"fond des choses\", ou du moins constituer un tel fond, et traiter de chaque chose à partir de ce fond, il [sera] ridicule de disputer à Descartes la qualité de métaphysicien\" (90).One of the more interesting of these early chapters is the one in which Kambouchner investigates the objet or purpose of the Meditations, and here he goes beyond the perfunctory treatment usually accorded this question in similar books. He takes seriously the apologetic nature of the work with respect to the proofs of God’s existence and the immortality of the soul (whereby Descartes’s target is the libertine or atheist). \"La contribution des Méditations à la ’cause de la Religion’ est-elle donc chose qu’il faut renoncer à prendre au sérieux? Nullement . . . [A]ux yeux de Descartes, aucun lecteur attentive de ces Méditations ne pourra manquer d’acquérir de l’existence de Dieu et de l’immortalité de nôtre âme une très parfaite certitude\" (74). He also examines with great care the work’s function in providing epistemological and ontological foundations for Cartesian mechanistic science (whereby the target is the Scholastic professor wedded to the Aristotelian system). As for whether or not one of Descartes’s targets is also the skeptic, as has been often claimed (most notably by Popkin and Curley), here Kambouchner is himself a bit more skeptical. He argues that, rather than the Pyrrhonian, the more likely opponent here, because he represents a greater danger to Descartes’s scientific program, is the probablistic empiricist (such as Gassendi).Of course, the real work in any book such as this comes with the analysis of the meditations themselves. Kambouchner succeeds here beautifully. He does a fine job in his examination of the First Meditation of providing both the basic explanations needed for enlightening the novice and the more complex inquiries expected by the seasoned specialist. He begins by offering a defense of Descartes against the charge that he misconstrues the nature and structure of human knowledge, and also provides a plausible justification for Descartes’s use of the method of doubt. In his thorough consideration of this method, Kambouchner looks at the process or experience of doubting itself, the obstacles to be overcome (e.g., the force of habit in our everyday beliefs) and the means of overcoming them, and the nature of the doubt ultimately engendered by the method (contrasting it, for example, with the state of epokhé pursued by ancient skepticism). Kambouchner is especially good in these sections at bringing to our attention certain tensions, inconsistencies, and problems in Descartes’s text(s) and in proposing plausible resolutions for them. He is interested in, among other things, the perennial question of whether or not the reasons for doubt are (to cite Descartes himself) \"hyperbolic and ridiculous\" or \"very strong and quite considerable\", as well as in the issues of who exactly the meditator is supposed to be and whether all of the principles subjected to the method of doubt in the First Meditation are intended to be empirical ones, grounded in either the naïve or critical use of the senses.Finally, Kambouchner turns to the particular arguments of the First Meditation, those intended to instill in the meditator the epistemological doubts from which the cogito and the existence of God are to provide the fulcrum for his rescue. Kambouchner generally adopts a careful, level-headed approach. He is sensitive to the variety of texts that must be used when offering a deep interpretation of the Meditations (the Rules for the Direction of the Mind, the Discourse on Method, the Search After Truth, the \"Conversations with Burman\", etc.) and to the different ways in which they must be brought into play. He also tends to avoid extremes in his interpretations, and does not have any obvious axes to grind.Two elements of this part of his book are especially noteworthy. First, Kambouchner offers a very sensible answer to the question of the relationship between the deceiving God argument and the doctrine of the creation of the eternal truths. He takes exception to a common scholarly tendency to closely link the two. He grants that they have between them \"un air de famille\" that makes a \"rapprochement\" inevitable – indeed, they both derive from a recognition of God’s omnipotence. But this should not lull us into overlooking crucial differences between them, what Kambouchner calls an \"opposition diamétral qui est aussi une essentielle dissymétrie\" (327). In essence, not only is it the case that one doctrine has God creating truths while the hypothesis of \"Dieu trompeur\" has God creating falsehoods, but the power of the \"Dieu trompeur\" is something we can basically grasp, if not fully comprehend, while the notion of God’s power to make it not be the case that 2+2=4 \"envelloppera un paradoxe insupportable\".Second, Kambouchner addresses the relationship between the hypothesis of \"Dieu trompeur\" and the fiction of the \"malin génie\", the evil deceiver. Here, too, Kambouchner resists a simple identification of the two. These possible sources of deception not only work in different ways, he insists, but they represent very different kinds of relationship to some powerful being. Kambouchner argues, first, that the power of the evil deceiver should not, despite appearances, be confused with the omnipotence of God. He then claims that because the deceiving God is depicted as the creative source of our being, hence of our systematically unreliable faculties, such a divinity would be much more remote from us than an evil deceiver who, on Kambouchner’s reading, is intimately involved in causing our particular illusions, being the instigator of our non-veridical experience or representations of things. Above all, he concludes, an all-powerful but deceiving God is, in fact, something incomprehensible, a self-defeating hypothesis (as Descartes hopes to show in his subsequent proof that God cannot be a deceiver), whereas the evil deceiver is, while hyperbolic, still quite conceivable, particularly since this deceiver runs up against the limits of my will insofar as he cannot actually force me to believe anything.There is something missing from Kambouchner’s discussion here, however. He recognizes that, on at least one occasion, in the conversation with Burman, Descartes says that the evil deceiver has created him (\"me creavit\"). So why should there necessarily be these differences of mechanics and of proximity or intimacy between the two hypotheses? Perhaps the evil deceiver argument does indeed work in the same way as the \"Dieu trompeur\" argument works: the deceiver has maliciously created me with faulty faculties. On this reading, the evil deceiver hypothesis is substituted for the deceiving God hypothesis only to avoid attributing (incoherently and impiously) such malice to God. Kambouchner seems to be aware of this possibility of assimilating the two hypotheses, suggested by Descartes’s remarks to Burman (365), but he does not address it seriously.One of the virtues of this book, all too rarely found in the French literature on Descartes, is a real engagement with English-language scholarship. This is, without question, one of the best books on the Meditations to appear in a long time. It is certainly the finest, and most thorough, treatment that the First Meditation has received since Harry Frankfurt’s Demons, Dreamers and Madmen (which was, incidentally, as far as I know, the first study of Descartes by an Anglo-American philosopher to be translated into French). The three-volume work should, when completed, become one of those magisterial studies (like Gueroult’s two-volume masterpiece, Descartes selon l’ordre des raisons) that is standard reading for generations. I am very much looking forward to the next two installments.",

    "abstract": "A striking feature of Newton’s thought is the very broad reach of his empiricism, potentially extending even to immaterial substances, including God, minds, and should one exist, a non-perceiving immaterial medium. Yet Newton is also drawn to certain metaphysical principles—most notably the principle that matter cannot act where it is not—and this second, rationalist feature of his thought is most pronounced in his struggle to discover “gravity’s cause”. The causal problem remains vexing, for he neither invokes primary causation, nor accepts action at a distance by locating active powers in matter. To the extent that he is drawn to metaphysical principles, then, the causal problem is that of discovering some non-perceiving immaterial medium. Yet Newton’s thought has a third striking feature, one with roots in the other two: he allows that substances of different kinds might simultaneously occupy the very same region of space. I elicit the implications of these three features. For Newton to insist upon all three would transform the causal question about gravity into an insoluble problem about apportioning active powers. More seriously, it would undermine his means of individuating substances, provoking what I call “Newton’s Substance Counting Problem”.",
    "annote": "I shall argue, it would not be possible for Newton to resolve the causal problem about gravity as he conceives it while insisting upon all three elements. To do so would transform the question about gravity’s causal means of operation into an insoluble problem about apportioning active principles or powers. More seriously, it would undermine his means of individuating substances, provoking what I shall call “Newton’s Substance Counting Problem”.",

    "abstract": "Although Newton carefully eschews questions about gravity’s causal basis in the published Principia, the original version of his masterwork’s third book contains some intriguing causal language. “These forces,” he writes, “arise from the universal nature of matter.” Such remarks seem to assert knowledge of gravity’s cause, even that matter is capable of robust and distant action. Some commentators defend that interpretation of the text—a text whose proper interpretation is important since Newton’s reasons for suppressing it strongly suggest that he continued to endorse its ideas. This article argues that the surface appearance of Newton’s causal language is deceptive. What does Newton intend with his causal language if not a full causal hypothesis? His remarks actually indicate a way of considering the force mathematically, something he contrasts to the structure of the force as it really is in nature. In explaining that, he identifies a significant disjunction between the physical force itself and mathematical ways of considering it, and the text’s significance lies in its view of the force’s structure and in the questions raised about the relationship between mathematical representations and the physical world.",

Problems of motion were treated in natural philosophy, along with proportion theory and intention and remission. Topics associated with the balance and lever were part of the science of weight, itself a part of mathematics. The science was based on the work of Jordanus of Nemore, less on Archimedes. And simple machines were considered within the practical, mechanical arts. However, the availability of <i>Questiones</i>Questiones in the 16th century prompts a renegotiation of these boundaries. “commentators took great care to distinguish this new science of mechanics from practical mechanics on the one hand and from natural philosophy of the other (p.45)”commentators took great care to distinguish this new science of mechanics from practical mechanics on the one hand and from natural philosophy of the other (p.45).<b>Characteristics of Sixteenth-Century Mechanics</b><b>Characteristics of Sixteenth-Century Mechanics</b>Characteristics of Sixteenth-Century Mechanics Four characteristics distinguished mechanics from other sciences. 1. It was theoretical rather than manual. 2. it was mathematical, although its subject was natural. 3. it considered motion and effects against nature. 4. it produced motion for human ends. Before the translation of the <i>Questiones</i>Questiones it was unclear how to interpret Aristotle’s comments regarding mechanics, so commentators did not consider it on par with Optics, Harmonics, and Astronomy, but rather as some sort of engineering art the precise nature of which was unknown. “One of the effects of the reintroduction of the <i>Mechanical Problems</i>... was to elevate mechanics to the status of a theoretical, intermediate science and to apply to it the theory of subalternation elaborated in the Middle Ages and still actively discussed in the sixteenth century (p.47)”One of the effects of the reintroduction of the <i>Mechanical Problems</i>Mechanical Problems... was to elevate mechanics to the status of a theoretical, intermediate science and to apply to it the theory of subalternation elaborated in the Middle Ages and still actively discussed in the sixteenth century (p.47).<b>Commentators on the Mechanical Problems: Humanist Philosophers</b><b>Commentators on the Mechanical Problems: Humanist Philosophers</b>Commentators on the Mechanical Problems: Humanist Philosophers The interest of the humanists was more philological and philosophical than mathematical. <b>Niccoló Leonico Tomeo</b>Niccoló Leonico Tomeo The first Latin translation was made by the Venetian humanist Vittore Fausto (1580–1551?) and published in 1517, although supplanted by Tomeo’s 1525 translation (also in Venice, 1456-1531). Tomeo merely repeats the characterization of mechanics given in the first few paragraphs of the <i>Questiones</i>Questiones. <b>Alessando Piccolomini (1508–1579)</b>Alessando Piccolomini (1508–1579) extensive commentary equated mechanics to optics and harmonics in terms of subalternation. Nevertheless, he held on to the idea that mechanics concerns acts against nature. <b>Mathematical Practitioners: Niccolo Tartaglia (1499–1557)</b>Mathematical Practitioners: Niccolo Tartaglia (1499–1557). Unlike the humanists, the math practitioners were aware of the mathematical works of Pappus, Hero, Archimedes, and Jordanus. Tartaglia considered the science of weights the theoretical part of mechanics, and a predominantly mathematical science. Physical arguments were not to be used at all; only confirmatory observations were allowed. “Tartaglia could thus assert the superiority of mathematical arguments over physical arguments and then explain their different conclusions as the result of material hindrances”Tartaglia could thus assert the superiority of mathematical arguments over physical arguments and then explain their different conclusions as the result of material hindrances. He used the term “subalternate science”subalternate science. However, he did not attempt to reconcile Archimedean and Jordanian proofs, siding mostly with the Jordanian (and <i>Questiones</i>Questiones) reliance of virtual velocities, not Archimedean equilibrium.",

    "annote": "Lennox cites this essay with great approval. The study is based on <i>Physics</i>Physics 2.2 and <i>Metaphysics</i>Metaphysics M3. Thesis: Aristotle has a genuine philosophy of mathematics that does not collapse into Platonism. Although this is also (<b>Muel70?</b>)’s intent, Lear holds that Mueller mistakingly falls into the common conception that for Aristotle physical bodies do not perfectly instantiated mathematical properties. Lear holds that this mistake leads to the psuedo-Platonic dillema: if mathematical knowledge if true of things that cannot obtain in the physical world, what is it true of?The discussion begins with analysis of the argument against Mathematical Platonism. Aristotle’s position is such that various substances can be considered in different aspects: so man can be considered as indivisible, and planet can be considered as moving, etc. In relation to magnitudes, Lear writes:The theory [of alternating proportions] is about spatial magnitudes and numbers, only not as spatial magnitude or number, but rather as magnitude [<i>simpliciter</i>simpliciter]; that is, they exhibit a common property, and they are being considered solely in respect of thisLear dubs this with-respect-ness as the introduction of a <i>qua</i>qua-operator, and puts things is spiffy logical form. The argument is that in <i>Metaphysics</i>Metaphysics M.3 Aristotle hold that the distinction between necessary and incidental properties can only be considered in light of the <i>qua</i>qua operator, i.e., under a certain description of a substance. The standard interpretation is that essential predicates are those that make the substance what it is. In M.3, the distinction can only be made under a description (i.e., b as an F), even if the described property (F) may be essential to b’s being the substance that it is.Why does this not lead to falsity? Lear has a discussion that makes a mountain our of a mole-hill. His point is merely that any positing of a seperable object as existant is as a useful fiction, not as an independently existing substance.This interpretation rests on the assumption that Aristotle thought that physical objects really do instantiate geomtrical properties. Two passages suggest a contrary thesis. In <i>Metaphysics</i>Metaphysics B.2 (the tangent to the bronze sphere) and K.1 ... I need to re-read section II.Section III deals with the difference between geometry and arithmatic.",

    "abstract": "Isaac Newtonâ€™s views on the mindâ€“body relation are of interest not only because of their somewhat unique departure from popular early modern conceptions of mind and its relation to body, but also because of their connections with other aspects of Newtonâ€™s thought. In this paper I argue that (1) Newton accepted an interesting sort of mindâ€“body monism, one which defies neat categorization, but which clearly departs from Cartesian substance dualism, and (2) Newton took the power by which we move our bodies by thought alone to be a member of the family of forces that includes gravity and electricity. Time and again, Newton draws an analogy between the ultimate cause and nature of the volitional powers of mind and the ultimate cause and nature of these other forces.",

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the developments experienced by natural philosophy and mathematics in Bologna during a period of rapid change in the relationship of the various disciplines in the faculty of Arts and Medicine. Insisting that university science was characterized by a greater vitality than the traditional historiography usually concedes, this examination first offers some comments about the place of natural philosophy in the Italian universities, then discusses more specifically the University of Bologna. Changes that took place in the funding of natural philosophy, in the designation of astronomy and mathematics, and in the cycle of books read for natural science are all examined in turn and are complemented by a series of tables.",
    "annote": "Good quotes on the nature of Renaissance Universities, and the flux of natural philosophy and mathematics. \"In Italy as elsewhere, natural philosophy was one of the three standard philosophical branches (natural philosophy, moral philosophy, and metaphysics) studies i nthe universities. p.132 Bottom of p.134 notes that Jesuits criticized universities for their lack of a graduated curriculum. This sort of criticism would suggest that Jesuit institutions kept to the Ratio strictly – after all, they took it as a point of pride that they reformed the chaotic curriculum of the standard university.Lines also makes clear, with lots of references to Grendler (2002), that Astronomy was taught as a branch of mathematics. I can use this fact as justification that when Descartes, etc. thinks of \"mathematics\" they also think of mixed mathematics.\"The rolls suggest a rigid separation between mathematics and natural philosophy in Renaissance university teaching. Although there are some examples of individuals who taught both astrology and physics in Bologna during the 14th century, I know of no teacher there who taught both natural philosophy and mathematics during the 15th and 16th centuryes. The reasons commonly offered for this kind of arrangement are well known: that medieval science was inherently indifferent or opposed to experimentation, since philosophers were more preoccupied with the unchanging principles of nature than with measuring and observing its phenomena. However, none of this explain why the relationship between the two fields seem to be more visible during the 13th and 14th centuries... [some evidence for increased experimentation].... One explanation for the dissociation one can observe between natural philosophy and mathematics may be the increasing specialization taking place within philosophy itself.",

    "abstract": "Alessandro Piccolomini and several other prominent 16th-century Aristotelians claimed that while a sphere touches a plane at a point in geometry, a material sphere touches a plane not at a point but over a small surface. These thinkers thereby called into question the reliability of geometric reasoning in physics. In this article I provide a detailed analysis of Galileo&rsquo;s reply to such worries about geometry in the Second Day of his <i>Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems</i>. Because his infamous extrusion argument relies on the premise that a sphere touches a plane at a point, Galileo takes the opportunity to defend the argument and to attack geometry&rsquo;s critics. According to the account I propose, Galileo argues for the applicability of geometry to physics by defending the legitimacy of geometric approximations and by advocating an expansive notion of geometric curve.",

    "annote": "Work in the mixed science tradition beginning with pseudo-Euclid and Archimedes is an instance of the theory of science of the <i>Posterior Analytics</i>. The crux of the theory is that 1) a subordinate science depends on the superior for its proofs and principles, 2) the subordinate science treates knowledge of the fact, the superior of the reasoned fact, 3) subordinate sciences are perceptual, superior are mathematical. McKirahan analyses the examples of optics/geometry and harmonics/arithmatics and question cases of triple suordinate sciences, such as arithmatics/mathematical harmonics/acoustical harmonics. The division corresponds to something like pure, applied, and experimental science, although McKirahan doesn’t use this language. He then analyses the 3 theses in relation to each pair in the triple, concluding that they only hold with respect to certain pairs and with certain qualifications. The argument seems mostly right. The main problem seems to me that“fact gathering\" is difficult to fit into the subordinate science. Open avenues of investigation should be whether Aristotle on fact gathering provides further evidence, and whether a moden conception of experimental sciences can help out Aristotle. However, a careful study with lots of references. Oh, McKirahan self-consciouly mirror Zabarella’s treatment of the mixed sciences!! Following Zabarella, he introduces a nice turn of phrase to indicate a form of treatment (i.e., geometrical treatment): <i>modus considerandi</i>.",

    "abstract": "Abstract  Over the last few years a resurgence of Newtonian studies has led to a deeper understanding of several aspects of his Philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica. Besides the new translation of Newton’s masterpiece, these contributions touched on his mathematical style, investigative method, experimental endeavors, and conceptual systematization of key notions in mechanics and the science of motion (I. Newton, The “Principia”. A new translation by I. Bernard Cohen and Anne Whitman assisted by Julia Budenz (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1999), hereafter New translation. Readers can find a useful bibliography on Newton in I.B. Cohen and G. Smith, eds, The Cambridge Companion to Newton (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002, hereafter Cambridge Companion), 465–80.). With regard to the last topic, recent works have identified two notions where Newton’s choices look unclear and scholarly opinion is divided. These notions are materiae vis insita or vis inertiae, namely the inherent force of matter or force of inertia, and vis centrifuga or centrifugal force. It is my conviction that the two notions became inter-related in Newton’s thought starting from the time of composition of the Principia and that a new look at them will simultaneously clarify matters about both. Newton’s beliefs about the nature of centrifugal force did not affect his calculations of planetary and cometary orbits in the Principia, but they are none the less of considerable intellectual interest. After a brief introduction on Huygens and the early Newton, Sect. 2 focuses on Newton’s views in the Principia and its preliminary manuscripts. Section 3 presents a summarized account of Leibniz’s views, which are necessary for understanding Newton’s criticism of them. This is the subject of Sect. 4, where we find his views most fully spelled out.",

Follow a discussion of several commentators, including Alexander, Ammonius, Philoponus, Proclus, Simplicius. The basic idea is that Aristotle’s first interpreters read him as an “abtractionist” (which Mueller think is wrong?), but later commentators, inspired by Platonic and Pythagorean idea start to hold a “Projectionist” position on mathematics. First page of article has nice 4 option on how to read aristotle on mathematical objects.",

    "annote": "Two positions exist regarding Descartes’ derivation of the laws of motion. First, that the laws of motion are fully establishbed by the essence of God, perhaps in a logically rigorous sense. This means that both their content and truth is grounded in God. Second, that God’s essence only determines the general features of such laws, setting constraints without determining any particular set (Williams). Nadler’s position in that, in the Principles, Descartes believes that God’s essence uniquely determines the content of laws of motion, although this is not a rigorous processes of logical entailment. The confirmation of the laws as the“true\" laws is based on empirical evidence. In Le Monde, the situation is tighter and more akin to to logical entailment.On p. 366, Nadler links the laws with God’s attributes, but claims that this is an“interpretive reconstruction\". In the text itself, Descartes is not very explicit or clear on just what stepts the arguments involve. This is what lead Bernard Williams to conclude that Descartes does not think that the laws of“determinately deducible from the nature of God.\" In fact, Nadler does not see a necessary connection between the god’s immutability and the *particular* law of conservation found in the principles.Section 2 is a reconstruction of the deduction of the laws, focusing on the ontological ground of the laws.Section 3 is a reconstruction of the epistemological basis of the laws. The evidence for Nadler’s positive view is given here.Section 4 concerns the counter-arguments. The end of the section (378ff) is the heart of the argument and appeals to evidence from Le Monde about Descartes’ general philosophy of science.Nadler ultimately appeals to the distinction between \"explaining\" and \"proving\" which Descartes mentions in both Le Monde and in letter to Morin.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Over the last two decades a new scholarship on alchemy has emerged, leading to a fundamental reformulation of knowledge about alchemists and their activities. We now know that medieval and early modern alchemists employed experiment in concert with theory to demonstrate the existence of stable “chymical atoms,” which were thought to combine with one another according to a hierarchical theory of matter. Employing laboratory-based analysis and synthesis, alchemists were among the first explicitly to enunciate the principle of mass balance and to show that materials are compounded of the ingredients into which they can be physically decomposed. Perhaps even more surprisingly, these convictions and practices arose out of the interaction of alchemical practice with scholastic Aristotelianism, long viewed by historians of the Scientific Revolution as antithetical to experiment. Thus the new historiography challenges both a long-standing marginalization of alchemy itself and a commonplace view of Aristotelianism as inimical to the early modern growth of experimental science.",

    "abstract": "Newton’s ’Principia’ was the crowning achievement of 17th Century Natural Philosophy, bringing together the works of great thinkers like Galileo and Johanes Kepler. This great work supplied the momentum for the Scientific Revolution and dominated physics for over 200 years. Although it was later demonstrated to have limitations at the atomic level, the principles of Newtonian physics are still applicable to much of our everyday lives. The casual reader may find this book difficult to work through, however. Newton’s three laws of motion are not stated in the language that is used in modern introductory physics texts. A good companion to this book is ’Feynman’s Lost Lecture’ in which Richard Feyman demonstrates planetary motion using the same geometric techniques employed by Isaac Newton, but in a more clear, modern style.",

    "annote": "The purpose of the article is to show that Aristotle’s wheel is a “transformation machine”transformation machine placed between theories of matter and theories of motion. It is also meant to show the relations between the <i>continuum physicum</i>continuum physicum and the <i>continuum mathematicum</i>continuum mathematicum in Galileo’s and Gassendi’s thought.The problem of the rolling sphere was used to motivate nominalist theories of the continuum in the middle ages. The issues was the following: if a circle touches a line at a point, a rolling circle will trace out a collection of points, not an Aristotelian continuum. I take it the conflict is that the line is supposed to be infinitely divisible, and in this case it is made from a collection of finite quantities. As an answer, Periera and Piccolomini, e.g., held that mathematical points had no physical reality. The nominalist solution was to deny the reality even of the mathematical point, and to hold the existence of finite although unimaginably small magnitudes. The problem is mentioned in Algazel, Chatoon, Gerard of Odo, Crathorn and Harclay, Buridan, Burley, Wodeham, Alnwick, Avicenna, and Maimonides.The evolution in Galileo’s thought regarding atomism is detailed. Initially, he considers physical atoms extended and holds that mathematical reasoning must be distinguished from physical reasoning! Nice quotes. Palmerino holds the opinion changes in order for Galileo to answer “two question concerning the behavior of material bodies and also to provide an implicit justification for one of the fundamental principles of his theory of fall”two question concerning the behavior of material bodies and also to provide an implicit justification for one of the fundamental principles of his theory of fall. The two problem are cohesion and rarefaction/condensation (which in the previous page she blames Shea for noting because those are “clearly cited by Galileo”clearly cited by Galileo). Regarding these, the characterization of the difference between solid and liquids, which impinges on the notion of resolution and composition seems doubtful. Look carefully, especially at the context of quotes, which are disembodied. The principles for the theory of fall are that space, time, and motion are composed of extensionless indivisibles. The principle is the continuity of motion and time. The argument here is based on a single passage, which is not particularly clear itself.After the single passage, Palmerino returns to an analysis of the mathematics/physics distinction and cites passages from the <i>Dialogue</i>Dialogue in whic the bronze sphere and Salviati’s counter argument are discussed. The passages and interesting, they show that Galileo did not conviece of material embodiment as a corruption. Mathematics can describe <i>material entities</i>material entities perfectly!! Palmerino argued against Feldhay, who considers Galileo’s argument simplistic, that it is not. Or rather, she just states that.",

    "abstract": "This article analyzes the evolution of Mersenne’s views concerning the validity of Galileo’s theory of acceleration. After publishing, in 1634, a treatise designed to present empirical evidence in favor of Galileo’s odd-number law, Mersenne developed over the years the feeling that only the elaboration of a physical proof could provide sufficient confirmation of its validity. In the present article, I try to show that at the center of Mersenne’s worries stood Galileo’s assumption that a falling body had to pass in its acceleration through infinite degrees of speed. His extensive discussions with, or his reading of, Descartes, Gassendi, Baliani, Fabri, Cazre, Deschamps, Le Tenneur, Huygens, and Torricelli led Mersenne to believe that the hypothesis of a passage through infinite degrees of speed was incompatible with any mechanistic explanation of free fall.",

    "annote": "Euclid’s fifth book defines “equimultiple”equimultiple proportionality for any magnitudes whatsoever, and “rational”rational proportionality for rational quantities (number, for Euclid). Euclid never shows that the rational prop. is deducible for equimultiple prop, of vice versa. Clavious provided this equivalence in his commentary on the <i>Elements</i>Elements (1574). Galileo believes that equimultiple proportionality was “obscure”obscure and provided a new definition in 1641, dicating the tract to Toricelli. Galileo shows that his definition is equivalent to equimultiple prop. Paolo argues that Galileo’s tract echoes Calvius, in formal detail, orientation, and intent. The paper also show “some of the difficulties encountered by Galileo in applying the equimultiple technique outside of the domain of pure mathematics, and which may eventually have led [Galileo] to seek an alternative to Euclid’s equimultple proportionality. §1 Clavius held that ratios of rational quantities, since they can always be reduced to rations of numbers (Element X), wear their “similarity”similarity on their sleeve, so, since proportionality is defined in terms of similarity between rations, he went back to this notion to try to shed light on the equimultiple definition. He held that Euclid framed the equimultiple definition in order to show that proportions of irrational quantities show that same fundamental characteristic of rational proportions. Clavius proof in complicated because numbers are non-continuous quantities and rations of numbers are not fraction in the modern sense. This means that manipulations of rations can only be carried out within the framework of properties available in the arithmetical books of the <i>Elements</i>Elements (which aren’t too rich) (p.572).§about Galileo’s definition. Galileo’s tract starts by noting that if we are to understand the “nature”nature of proportional magnitudes, we need to pick one of their properties... Galileo’s definition seems no more obvious that Euclid’s and Paolo believes that Galileo worked backwards from Clavius’ model to arrive at his general property (Clavius just showed equivalence, he did not reduce both types of proportion to a single property).Galileo’s definition of proportionality, Paolo argues, must be understood visually. Galileo is not simply assuming that a unique proportionality exist (and Guisti claims), but “sweeping away the difficult task of actually having to construct magnitudes that are proportional according to his new definition and replacing this task with a visual aid (p.584)”sweeping away the difficult task of actually having to construct magnitudes that are proportional according to his new definition and replacing this task with a visual aid (p.584). In other words, instead of the rigor of proving existence by finding the right ratio, he simply provides a diagram that makes obvious that such a ratio exists. “In other words, Galileo seems to be transferring the idea of proportional numbers – in the sense of Euclidean arithmetical proportionality – into the domain of continuous magnitudes, which have the added bonus of being easier to manipulate visually than integers (p. 584).",

    "annote": "How did Galileo mathematize nature? We need to pay attention to the form of his mathematics in order to answer this. In particular, we need to pay attention to the “mental models”mental models underlying his use of Euclidean proportions as the language of early mathematized physics. The core insight is that some of Galileo’s reasoning is not expresible in the language of Euclidean proportions, thus it must be expressible as a “mental model”mental model. §2 on mental models and their use in history, with the aim in showing that they are not necessarily ahistorical. Models are generalized images: they are isomorphic to the situations they represent, but can represent abstract elements that cannot be imagined and classes of physically realizeable situations. Models can be both kinematics and dynamic. §3 on the visual dimension of Galileo’s proportional reasoning. Being with the postulate underlying the 1588 theorems on the centers of gravity. There are two undefined notions: similarity and “being in the same ratio”being in the same ratio i.e., proportionality. Galileo exlicitly accept the equimultiple definition of proportionality, but allow similarity, which for him implies proportionality, to be determined visually.Euclid first proved that equiangular triangles have proportional sides and then deduced their similarity, whereas Galileo first recognised within his mental model the similarity of configurations of weights and then conjectured the proportionality of their arms... Galileo’s postulate is to all intents and purposes tantamount to a conjecture on the very nature of proportional magnitudes, ofr a clear reason. Galileo has no proof that equimultiple proportionality can be successfully applied to the case of his balances. Therefore, he is claiming that proportionalities can be generated on only be directly pplying the equimultiple technique but also by means of... the construction of visually similar configurations of physica magnitudes... Thus, Galileo’s mental model of similar balances succeeds in rendering homogeneous the world of Euclidean proportionality and the world of physical quantities. (p.242)In §5, Paolo speculates that Galileo borrowed the balance model from Pappus, who uses it to analyze the <i>potentia</i>potentia required to move a sphere down an inclined plane. Pappus (republished by Commandino in 1588 and 1602), saw a balance “within”within the inclined plane case, and Paolo suggests Galileo does the same within his proof of Archimedes’ law in <i>Discosi</i>Discosi and <i>Mecaniche</i>Mecaniche, seeing a balance “within”within a cylinder in equilibrium. Another good quote:I have suggested that some aspects of Galileo’s mathematization were cognitively dependent on non-symbolic mental models. The deduction toolkit of Euclid’s theory of proportions simply furnished the symbolic structure of Galileo’s mathematization. Indeed, it was the use of mental models that provided the innovation allowing Galileo to breakthrough the barrier of Euclidean and Archimedean traditions. (p.254)In §6 Paolo argues that mental models explain modes of Galileo’s argumentation to which the category of “thought experiments”thought experiments does no justice.",

Its current status contrasts with its former exile as a “pseudoscience” or worse and results from several rehabilitative steps carried out by scholars who made closer, less programmatic, and more innovative studies of the documentary sources. Interestingly, alchemy’s outcast status was created in the eighteenth century and perpetuated thereafter in part for strategic and polemical reasons—and not only on account of a lack of historical understanding. Alchemy’s return to the fold of the history of science highlights important features about the development of science and our changing understanding of it.",

    "abstract": "The widely accepted supposition that Newton’s De gravitatione was written in 1684/5 just before composing the Principia is examined. The basis for this determination has serious difficulties starting with the failure to examine the numerical estimates for the resistance of aether. The estimated range is not nearly nil as claimed but comparable with air at or near the earth’s surface. Moreover, the evidence provided most likely stems from experiments by Boyle, Hooke, and others in the 1660s and does not use evidence available in the late 1684. The document supports Newton’s contention that the aether medium incorporates very large voids thereby proving that body and space differ but does by no means completely reject its corporeal nature or eliminate its resistance. Newton’s use of the term inertia provides no conclusive evidence for a late date as often claimed and his definition of gravitas is difficult to reconcile with a late one.",

Instead, Geometrical method, \"logistica,\" is unique among his means of knowing. Although it conforms to pronouncements common to all inquiry, It also combines analytic and synthetic reasoning in peculiar ways. His definitive formulation is here retrieved from near-Oblivion, And its stipulations are discussed in detail. It follows from these that no other science is derivable from mathematics, According to his scheme. Only civil philosophy, Because modeled after geometry, Is able to attain a like exactitude and certainty.",

Rather than refutation of commentaries and historical rehash, the effort here is to isolate definitive texts and to offer a reinterpretation of their arguments in succinct form showing their coherence and their interdependence with his other philosophic principles.",

Especially, it shows what the concept of“mathesis universalis\" meant before and during the period of Descartes, and how it influenced the young Descartes. In fact, it was the most fundamental mathematical discipline during the seventeenth century, and for Descartes a key notion which may have lead to his novel mathematics of algebraic analysis.\"–BOOK JACKET.",

The Oxford Calculators’ Middle Degree Theorem in Context. By: Sylla, Edith Dudley. Early Science & Medicine, 2010, Vol. 15 Issue 4/5, p338-370, 33p; Abstract: The core Oxford Calculators (here William Heytesbury, John Dumbleton, and Richard Swineshead) developed a science of kinematics in which the key concept was the \"latitude of velocity.\" Based upon the concept of \"latitude,\" the Calculators developed parts of a mathematical physics in deductive format that could be applied to quite various situations.

Le problème du continu pour la mathématisation galiléenne et la géométrie cavalierienne. By: Boulier, Philippe. Early Science & Medicine, 2010, Vol. 15 Issue 4/5, p371-409, 39p; Abstract: What reasons can a physicist have to reject the principle of a mathematical method, which he nonetheless uses (even in an implicit way) and which he used frequently in his unpublished works? We are concerned here with Galileo’s doubts and objections against Cavalieri’s \"geometry of indivisibles.\" One may be astonished by Galileo’s behaviour: Cavalieri’s principle is implied by the Galilean mathematization of naturally accelerated motion; some Galilean demonstrations in fact hinge on it. Yet, in the Discorsi (1638) Galileo seems to be opposed to this principle. The fundamental reason of Galileo’s reluctance with respect to Cavalieri’s geometry is to be sought in Galileo’s ideal of intelligibility. It is true that Galilean physics, and more particularly Galileo’s theories of motion and matter, faces deep paradoxes, which Cavalieri’s geometry succeeds to avoid, thanks to a clear determination of the concept of \"aggregatum.\" But while avoiding these difficulties, Cavalieri does not furnish any solution for the problems raised by Galilean physics.

The Geometrization of Motion: Galileo’s Triangle of Speed and its Various Transformations. By: Palmerino, Carla Rita. Early Science & Medicine, 2010, Vol. 15 Issue 4/5, p410-447, 38p; Abstract: This article analyzes Galileo’s mathematization of motion, focusing in particular on his use of geometrical diagrams. It argues that Galileo regarded his diagrams of acceleration not just as a complement to his mathematical demonstrations, but as a powerful heuristic tool. Galileo probably abandoned the wrong assumption of the proportionality between the degree of velocity and the space traversed in accelerated motion when he realized that it was impossible, on the basis of that hypothesis, to build a diagram of the law of fall. The article also shows how Galileo’s discussion of the paradoxes of infinity in the First Day of the Two New Sciences is meant to provide a visual solution to problems linked to the theory of acceleration presented in Day Three of the work. Finally, it explores the reasons why Cavalieri and Gassendi, although endorsing Galileo’s law of free fall, replaced Galileo’s diagrams of acceleration with alternative ones.

Deux exemples d’utilisation des mathématiques en musique dans le premier quatorzième siècle latin. By: Husson, Matthieu. Early Science & Medicine, 2010, Vol. 15 Issue 4/5, p448-473, 26p; Abstract: This article analyses the conditions under which mathematics could enter the field of fourteenth-century music. It distinguishes between descriptive and argumentative uses of mathematics. Jean de Murs’ uses of arithmetic to study musical time is an example of the former, Jean de Boen’s study of the division of the whole tone an example of the latter. It is furthermore explained how the mathematical descriptions appear to bring into agreement two types of constraint, namely the physical characteristics of sound and the aesthetic principles of the medieval discourse about music. Within these constraints, mathematics manages to fulfill different argumentative roles: it has an ontological function when music is seen as a part of the quadrivium; but an explicative function in the framework of the scientia media and, in an more innovative spirit for Jean de Boens, it provides a definition of the possible in the argumentation about the division of the whole tone.

Les débats sur les fondements de la perspective linéaire de Piero della Francesca à Egnatio Danti: un cas de mathématisation à rebours. By: Raynaud, Dominique. Early Science & Medicine, 2010, Vol. 15 Issue 4/5, p474-504, 31p; Abstract: In the Quattrocento and Cinquecento the rise of linear perspective caused many polemics which opposed the supporters of an artificial geometrisation of sight to those who were praising the qualities of the drawing according to nature, or were invoking some arguments on a physiological basis. These debates can be grouped according to the four alternatives that form their central concerns: restricted vs. broad field of vision; ocular immobility vs. mobility; curvilinear vs. planar picture; monocular vs. binocular vision. By retaining the first terms of these four alternatives, the history of perspective eliminated many heterodox constructions. From the viewpoint of mathematisation the interest of these debates is that they succeeded, rather than preceded, the adoption of a perspective system defined by the intersection of the visual pyramid. Thus the history of linear perspective constitutes a genuine case of a posteriori justification, or, put differently, it gives us a case of upside down mathematisation.

Mathématiser l’anatomie: la myologie de Stensen (1667). By: Andrault, Raphaële. Early Science & Medicine, 2010, Vol. 15 Issue 4/5, p505-536, 32p; Abstract: In his Elementorum Myologiae Specimen, Steno geometrizes \"the new fabric of muscles\" and their movement of contraction, so as to refute the main contemporary hypothesis about the functioning of the muscles. This physiological refutation relies on an abstract representation of the muscular fibre as a parallelepiped of flesh transversally linked to the tendons. Those two features have been comprehensively studied. But the method used by Steno, as well as the way he has chosen to present his physiological results, have so far been neglected. Yet, Steno’s work follows a true synthetic order, which he conceives as a tool to separate uncertain anatomical \"elements\" from the certain ones. We will show that the true understanding of this \"more geometrico\" order is the only way to avoid frequent misconceptions of the scientific aim pursued by Steno, which is neither to give a mathematical explanation of the functioning of the muscles, nor to reduce the muscles to some mathematical shapes.

Pascal versus Descartes on Solution of Geometrical Problems and the Sluse-Pascal Correspondence. By: Maronne, Sébastien. Early Science & Medicine, 2010, Vol. 15 Issue 4/5, p537-565, 29p; Abstract: In this article, I examine the respective role of equations and construction in geometrical problem solving according to Descartes and Pascal. I argue that whereas Descartes claims that an equation provides a solution to a geometrical problem even if it leads to an entangled construction, Pascal dismisses this claim and gives priority to construction. To this end, I deal with prototypical problems like Apollonius’ problem of the three cir cles or Pappus’ problem, both of which were tackled by Descartes and Pascal in their work or correspondence. I also pay close attention to the cor respondence between Pascal and Sluse of October-December 1657 and compare Sluse’s conception of algebraic analysis in geometrical problem solving with Descartes’. These letters, not thoroughly studied until now, supply an interesting discussion about what it is to provide a solution to a geometrical problem. Finally, I consider Descartes’ algebraization of geometry as a kind of mathematization.

    "abstract": "Newton rested his theory of mechanics on distinct metaphysical and epistemological foundations. After Leibniz’s death in 1716, the Principia ran into sharp philosophical opposition from Christian Wolff and his disciples, who sought to subvert Newton’s foundations or replace them with Leibnizian ideas. In what follows, I chronicle some of the Wolffians’ reactions to Newton’s notion of absolute space, his dynamical laws of motion, and his general theory of gravitation. I also touch on arguments advanced by Newton’s Continental followers, such as Leonhard Euler, who made novel attempts to defend his mechanical foundations against the pro-Leibnizian attack. This examination grants us deeper insight into the fate of Newton’s mechanics on the Continent during the early eighteenth century and, more specifically, sheds needed light on the conflicts and tensions that characterized the reception of Newton’s philosophy of mechanics among the Leibnizians.",

However, this label has been liable to common misunderstandings from the historical and even historiographical point of view. The article introduces some suitable distinctions (second-order extrapolation vs. geometrization, weak vs. strong sense, or use of the more geometrico programs) and reviews in this light three significant historical incidents in which this kind of program becomes apparent, focusing on its outstanding development in the 17th century., Type: Article, Entry: 47A:706, Language: Spanish, Period: 17c., Transl-Info: [The proof <i>more geometrico:</i> notes on the history of an extrapolation].",

    "abstract": "This book adopts the perspective that we should not approach Rene Descartes as a solitary thinker, but as a philosopher who constructs a dialogue with his contemporaries, so as to engage them and elements of his society into his philosophical enterprise. Roger Ariew argues that an important aspect of this engagement concerns the endeavor to establish Cartesian philosophy in the Schools, that is, to replace Aristotle as the authority there. Descartes wrote the ’Principles of Philosophy’ as something of a rival to Scholastic textbooks, initially conceiving the project as a comparison of his philosophy and that of the Scholastics. Still, what Descartes produced was inadequate for the task. The topics of Scholastic textbooks ranged more broadly than those of Descartes; they usually had quadripartite arrangements mirroring the structure of the collegiate curriculum, divided as they typically were into logic, ethics, physics, and metaphysics. But Descartes produced at best only what could be called a general metaphysics and a partial physics. These deficiencies in the Cartesian program and in its aspiration to replace Scholastic philosophy in the schools caused the Cartesians to rush in to fill the voids. The attempt to publish a Cartesian textbook that would mirror what was taught in the schools began in the 1650s with Jacques Du Roure and culminated in the 1690s with Pierre-Sylvain Regis and Antoine Le Grand. Ariew’s original account thus considers the reception of Descartes’ work, and establishes the significance of his philosophical enterprise in relation to the textbooks of the first Cartesians and in contrast with late Scholastic textbooks.–Back jacket",

It includes studies of Newton’s experimental methods in optics and their roots in Bacon and Boyle; Locke’s and Hume’s responses to Newton on the nature of matter, time, the structure of the sciences, and the limits of human inquiry. In addition it explores the use of Newtonian ideas in 18th-century pedagogy and the life sciences. Finally, it breaks new ground in analyzing the method of evidential reasoning heralded by the Principia, its nature, strength, and development in the subsequent three centuries of gravitational research. The volume will be of interest to historians of science and philosophy and philosophers interested in the nature of empiricism.",

    "abstract": "This volume of original papers by a leading team of international scholars explores Isaac Newton’s relation to a variety of empiricisms and empiricists. It includes studies of Newton’s experimental methods in optics and their roots in Bacon and Boyle; Locke’s and Hume’s responses to Newton on the nature of matter, time, the structure of the sciences, and the limits of human inquiry. In addition it explores the use of Newtonian ideas in 18th-century pedagogy and the life sciences. Finally, it breaks new ground in analyzing the method of evidential reasoning heralded by the Principia, its nature, strength, and development in the subsequent three centuries of gravitational research. The volume will be of interest to historians of science and philosophy and philosophers interested in the nature of empiricism.",

    "annote": "The main question is regarding the relationship of the method of the discourse and the metaphysics of the meditations. Marion present three existing alternatives: heteogeneity, homogeneity, and absence. Namely, metaphysics is absent from the discourse, metaphysics in the same in the discourse and meditations, or it is different. Interestingly, he cites Baillet as the first instance of the absence doctrine. Baillet wrote that \"It is claimed nevertheless that what little he [Descartes] offered is more worthy of the title logic or entry into Philosophy and all the other science than Aristotle’s Organon, because it is more simple and less Metaphysical and it appears more proper to minds which are not yet prepared with any knowledge\" (p. 166, note 5). He also notes that the application of doubt in the *Discourse* is imperfect, since doubt is only applied to sensory experience, not to mathematical truths, the external world, etc.Marion argues that the *Discourse* betrays a metaphysics on several grounds, p. 24-26, but falls short of the *Meditations* metaphysics on several grounds; e.g., the conception of God is different and the use of the principle of causality is absent.But some elements are present. Marion holds that the \"I\" of the *Discourse* is more metaphysical than the \"I\" of the *Meditations*. This is because the \"I\" of 1641 is a result of a temporally indexed performative, while the \"I\" of 1637 is the result of a robust inference. The 1637 \"I\" is thus more like a substance then the \"I\" of the meditations.",

The translations (though I am by no means a scholar of Greek) seem to be quite proper, and despite the fact that different sections may be translated by different people, there is no apparent unevenness. Ackrill laments in the introduction that it would have been more proper to leave about 30-40 Greek words (such as ’logos’, ’aitia’, ’ousia’) untranslated, since no single English word does them justice. But that since there are translations by several people involved, that was not possible. All in all, this would be a very handy book for anyone interested in Aristotle.",

    "abstract": "Legendary since his own time as a universal genius, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716) contributed significantly to almost every branch of learning. One of the creators of modern mathematics, and probably the most sophisticated logician between the Middle Ages and Frege, as well as a pioneer of ecumenical theology, he also wrote extensively on such diverse subjects as history, geology, and physics. But the part of his work that is most studied today is probably his writings in metaphysics, which have been the focus of particularly lively philosophical discussion in the last twenty years or so. The writings contain one of the great classic systems of modern philosophy, but the system must be pieced together from a vast and miscellaneous array of manuscripts, letters, articles, and books, in a way that makes especially strenuous demands on scholarship. This book presents an in-depth interpretation of three important parts of Leibniz’s metaphysics, thoroughly grounded in the texts as well as in philosophical analysis and critique. The three areas discussed are the metaphysical part of Leibniz’s philosophy of logic, his essentially theological treatment of the central issues of ontology, and his theory of substance (the famous theory of monads).",

Armstrong works out clearly and in comprehensive detail a largely original view that laws are relations between properties or universals. The theory is continuous with the views on universals and more generally with the scientific realism that Professor Armstrong has advanced in earlier publications. He begins here by mounting an attack on the orthodox and sceptical view deriving from Hume that laws assert no more than a regularity of coincidence between instances of properties. In doing so he presents what may become the definitive statement of the case against this position. Professor Armstrong then goes on to establish his own theory in a systematic manner defending it against the most likely objections, and extending both it and the related theory of universals to cover functional and statistical laws. This treatment of the subject is refreshingly concise and vivid: it will both stimulate vigorous professional debate and make an excellent student text.",

An invaluable history of ideas about the nature of language during this period, The Word of God and the Languages of Man also explores the wider cultural origins and impact of these ideas. Its broad and deeply complex picture of a profound sociocultural and intellectual transformation will alter our definition of the scientific revolution. James J. Bono shows how the new interpretive principles and scientific practices of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries evolved in response to new views of the relationship between the Word of God and the Languages of Man fostered by Renaissance Humanism, Neoplatonism, magic, and both the reformed and radical branches of Protestantism. He traces the cultural consequences of these ideas in the thought and work of major and minor actors in the scientific revolutionfrom Ficino and Paracelsus to Francis Bacon and Descartes. By considering these natural philosophers in light of their own intellectual, religious, philosophical, cultural, linguistic, and especially narrative frameworks, Bono suggests a new way of viewing the sociocultural dynamics of scientific change in the premodern periodand ultimately, a new way of understanding the nature and history of scientific thought. The narrative configuration he proposes provides a powerful alternative to the longstanding revolutionary metaphor of the history of the scientific revolution.",

    "abstract": "Maintaining a contemporary perspective, this strongly algebraic-oriented text provides a concrete and readable text for the traditional course in elementary differential equations that science, engineering, and mathematics readers take following calculus. Matters of definition, classification, and logical structure deserve (and receive here) careful attention for the first time in the mathematical experience of many of the readers. While it is neither feasible nor desirable to include proofs of the fundamental existence and uniqueness theorems along the way in an elementary course, readers need to see precise and clear-cut statements of these theorems, and understand their role in the subject. Appropriate existence and uniqueness proofs in the Appendix are included, and referred to where appropriate in the main body of the text. Applications are highlighted throughout the text. These include: What explains the commonly observed lag time between indoor and outdoor daily temperature oscillations?; What makes the difference between doomsday and extinction in alligator populations?; How do a unicycle and a two-axle car react differently to road bumps?; Why are flagpoles hollow instead of solid?; Why might an earthquake demolish one building and leave standing the one next door?; How can you predict the time of next perihelion passage of a newly observed comet?; Why and when does non-linearity lead to chaos in biological and mechanical systems?; What explains the difference in the sounds of a guitar, a xylophone, and a drum? Includes almost 300 computer-generated graphics throughout the text. This text, with enough material for 2 terms, provides a concrete and readable text for the traditional course in elementary differential equations that science, engineering, and mathematics readers take following calculus.",

Aristotle’s discussions of these interconnected topics are central to his account of thought and language, his metaphysics, and his study of biology. They are also of continuing philosophical importance, with considerable relevance for modern debates on these issues. Charles aims, on the basis of a careful and detailed reading of Aristotle’s texts, to reach a clear understanding of his distinctive claims and arguments, and to assess their value and significance. He argues that Aristotle’s actual account is distinct from the one often described and attacked as ’Aristotelian essentialism’. Indeed, in Charles’s view, it enjoys considerable advantages over more recent attempts to formulate and defend essentialist theses.",

Moral Discourse and Practice collects important recent work on these core metaethical issues. Reinvigorated naturalist moral realism and the various versions of moral realism, as well as irrealist, expressivist and neo-Kantian constructivist theories are all represented in this fine collection, testifying to the author’s attempt to objectively approach moral philosophy’s fundamental debates.",

    "abstract": "Although the Scientific Revolution has long been regarded as the beginning of modern science, there has been little consensus about its true character. While the application of mathematics to the study of the natural world has always been recognized as an important factor, the role of experiment has been less clearly understood.Peter Dear investigates the nature of the change that occurred during this period, focusing particular attention on evolving notions of experience and how these developed into the experimental work that is at the center of modern science. He examines seventeenth-century mathematical sciences–astronomy, optics, and mechanics–not as abstract ideas, but as vital enterprises that involved practices related to both experience and experiment. Dear illuminates how mathematicians and natural philosophers of the period–Mersenne, Descartes, Pascal, Barrow, Newton, Boyle, and the Jesuits–used experience in their argumentation, and how and why these approaches changed over the course of a century. Drawing on mathematical texts and works of natural philosophy from all over Europe, he describes a process of change that was gradual, halting, sometimes contradictory–far from the sharp break with intellectual tradition implied by the term ’revolution.’",

    "abstract": "This is a slim volume, unusual because it operates at a very general level across all three of Kant’s Critiques instead of the more usual focus on a single Critique. Deleuze’s aim is architectonic: to show how the three Critiques fit together to form a coherent whole. This is a valuable undertaking since it’s very easy to get lost in the Kantian thickets, which are arguably the densest in all of Western philosophy. Deleuze organizes the three Critiques around the core notion of faculties and the objects over which they legislate. For example, understanding legislates in the faculty of knowledge, while reason operates over the faculty of desire; taken individually, the study of each makes up the content of the first two of Kant’s celebrated Critiques. Their respective functions are shown by Deleuze to culminate in the third Critique (i.e. *Critique of Pure Judgement*), wherein the notion of ’ends’, both moral and cognitive, reach synthetic fulfillment. Hence, it is in the third Critique, instead of the first two, in which the capstone of Kant’s Copernican revolution is reached. Here in the arena of art and aesthetics, no faculty legislates, nor are generic objects present. Rather aesthetic judgement involves the faculties and imagination in a kind of free play aimed at some type of overall harmony. Rather than knowledge, which can only be phenomenal, culture represents humankind’s highest achievement and its measurement; and the highway into 19th century Romanticism opens. Kant is a giant of Western philosophy. This book aids in an understanding of his overall undertaking.",

Material is arranged thematically so as to indicate the main points of criticism which occured to Descartes‚Äô contemporaries as they read the Meditations, and how Descartes clarified his arguments in response to those criticisms.

This unique edition contains an improved version of the original Latin text, a new English translation intended to be as literal as possible and as liberal as necessary, an interpretive essay contextualizing the text historically, philologically, and philosophically, a com-prehensive index of Latin terms, a key glossary of English equivalents, and an extensive bibliography covering all aspects of Descartes’ methodology. Stephen Gaukroger has shown, in his authoritative ’Descartes: An Intellectual Biography’ (1995), that one cannot understand Descartes without understanding the early Descartes. But one also cannot understand the early Descartes without understanding the ’Regulae / Rules.’ Nor can one understand the ’Regulae / Rules’ without understanding a philosophical edition thereof. Therein lies the justification for this project. The edition is intended, not only for students and teachers of philosophy as well as of related disciplines such as literary and cultural criticism, but also for anyone interested in seriously reflecting on the nature, expression, and exercise of human intelligence: What is it? How does it manifest itself? How does it function? How can one make the most of what one has of it? Is it equally distributed in all human beings? What is ’natural’ about it, and what, not? In the ’Regulae / Rules’ Descartes tries to provide, from a distinctively early modern perspective, answers both to these and to many other questions about what he refers to as ’ingenium’.",

    "abstract": "In 1921, five years after the appearance of his comprehensive paper on general relativity and twelve years before he left Europe permanently to join the Institute for Advanced Study, Albert Einstein visited Princeton University, where he delivered the Stafford Little Lectures for that year. These four lectures constituted an overview of his then controversial theory of relativity. Princeton University Press made the lectures available under the title ’The Meaning of Relativity’, the first book by Einstein to be produced by an American publisher. As subsequent editions were brought out by the Press, Einstein included new material amplifying the theory. A revised version of the appendix ’Relativistic Theory of the Non-Symmetric Field,’ added to the posthumous edition of 1956, was Einstein’s last scientific paper.",

    "abstract": "Hans-Georg Gadamer’s Truth and Method must be considered alongside the great works of Dilthey, Husserl, and Heidegger as a major treatise on hermeneutics, defined by Gadamer as understanding and the correct interpretation of what has been understood. More commonly, people define hermeneutics as the study/theory of interpretation.Two major contentions that help frame his analysis are: (1) rejection of the view that proper understanding calls for eliminating the influence of the interpreter’s context; (2) rejection of the view that the author’s intent in writing a text has any special weight to it.As to the first point, he argues that it is simply not possible for the interpreter to escape his present situation. He advances the concept of the ’horizon.’ For Gadamer, the horizon is ’. . .the range of vision that includes everything that can be seen from a particular vantage point.’ It is the grounding of the interpreter, including that person’s language, that fixes the possibilities of what that person can see and understand. In Gadamer’s words, it is’. . .the way in which thought is tied to its finite determination, and the nature of the law of the expansion of the range of vision. A person who has no horizon is a man who does not see far enough and hence over values what is nearest to him. Contrariwise, to have an horizon means not to be limited to what is nearest, but to be able to see beyond it. A person who has an horizon knows the relative significance of everything within this horizon, as near or far, great or small.’To interpret the words of the past, Gadamer says that:’Just as in a conversation, when we have discovered the standpoint and horizon of the other person, his ideas become intelligible, without our necessarily having to agree with him, the person who thinks historically comes to understand the meaning of what has been handed down, without necessarily agreeing with it, or seeing himself in it.’In interpreting texts, two horizons are involved–one is the horizon of the interpreter and the other the particular historical horizon into which he or she places him or herself in trying to understand the text. Thus, the two horizons interact to produce understanding.The historical horizon of the text is not fixed; it cannot take on a meaning that is unchanged for all times and places. Here, he gets to the heart of successful hermeneutic inquiry–the fusing of horizons. He says:’Hence the horizon of the present cannot be formed with the past. There is no more an isolated horizon of the present than there are historical horizons. Understanding, rather, is always the fusion of these horizons which we imagine to exist by themselves. . .Every encounter with tradition that takes place within historical consciousness involves the experience of the tension between the text and the present.’But what of the intention of the original author of a text? That leads to another of Gadamer’s major points, by now clearly implicit in his idea of fusion of horizons. In short, it is not particularly important in trying to interpret a text. Once a text is created by its author, it becomes, so to speak, freed from the creator and begins to take on its own meaning, based upon its historical horizon, continually evolving as circumstances change. It is the text’s horizon that interacts with the interpreter’s horizon.So what? To the extent that ’reality’ is the subject of inquiry, our understanding of ’reality’ will change as the historical horizon of a particular claim about reality changes. We can, then, never come to a satisfactory conclusion about a transcendental reality, about an absolute truth. Is relativism the end product of the endeavor? The hermeneutist in the Gadamerian tradition would simply note that there is no way out.This is one of the most historically important works available on interpretation. It is difficult and challenging as a work; however, the effort to learn from Gadamer is well worth it.",

He argues neither for nor against the existence of a real world out beyond all our knowledge and our active efforts to cope with our experiences. He calls himself an ’irrealist,’ or someone who couldn’t care less whether or not such a real world exists. Ways of Worldmaking contains one brilliant argument after another for the idea that no appeal to a real world beyond our ’conceptual schemes’ is necessary to understand, or to produce, science and scientific knowledge. What’s more, Goodman also shows how art is just as necessary as science if we are to understand ourselves and the world. He explains that neither art nor science is a copy of the world: as the old joke has it, ’one of the damn things is enough.’ Instead both art and science succeed when they provide us with symbols that re-categorize things and people in ways we find useful. It is this usefulness, not a connection to a world beyond all categories, that we actually seek when we generate both theories and artworks. Notice that we do in fact stop our seeking when we achieve this kind of satisfaction. Goodman’s neo-pragmatic explanation of how we should investigate the world pays close attention, and gives proper respect, to the ways in which we actually do investigate. A wonderful book from an underappreciated thinker.",

No one philosopher contributed more to this enterprise than Kant, whose Critique of Pure Reason (1781) shook the very foundations of the intellectual world. Kant argued that the basic principles of the natural sciences are imposed on reality by human sensibility and understanding, and thus that human beings are also free to impose their own free and rational agency on the world. This volume is the only systematic and comprehensive account of the full range of Kant’s writings available, and the first major overview of his work to be published in more than a dozen years. An internationally recognized team of Kant scholars explore Kant’s conceptual revolution in epistemology, metaphysics, philosophy of science, moral and political philosophy, aesthetics, and the philosophy of religion.

    "abstract": "Common sense and philosophical tradition agree that mind makes a difference. What we do depends not only on how our bodies are put together, but also on what we think. Explaining how mind can make a difference has proved challenging, however. Some have urged that the project faces an insurmountable dilemma: either we concede that mentalistic explanations of behaviour have only a pragmatic standing or we abandon our conception of the physical domain as causally autonomous. Although each option has its advocates, most theorists have sought a middle way that accommodates both the common-sense view of mind and the metaphysical conviction about the physical world. This volume presents a collection of new, specially written essays by a diverse group of philosophers, each of whom is widely known for defending a particular conception of minds and their place in nature.

    "abstract": "Thomas Kuhn is perhaps the most widely known and influential philosopher of science of our time. His book ’The Structure of Scientific Revolutions ’called into question such central notions of scientific method as the concept of absolute truth, the observation/theory distinction, the determinate rationality of theory choice, and the normative function of philosophy of science. It replaced these with a historically more accurate model of scientific change. Kuhn’s critique turned several fields upside down and continues to be read and debated not only by philosophers and historians of science but also by many practicing scientists. Inspired by his contributions, these twelve original essays address central aspects of Kuhn’s thought. Most of the essays are philosophical, four are primarily historical, and one, by Kuhn himself, responds to issues raised in the other essays.Paul Horwich is Professor of Philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Incorporating discussion of key problems in general historical writing, with examples drawn from a range of disciplines, this non-elementary introduction bridges the gap between general history and history of science. Following a review of the early development of the history of science, the theory of history as applied to science history is introduced, examining the basic problems which this generates, including problems of periodisation, ideological functions, and the conflict between diachronical and anachronical historiography. Finally, the book considers the critical use, and analysis, of historical sources, and the possibility of the experiemental reconstruction of history. Aimed primarily at students, the book’s broad scope and integration of historical, philosophical and scientific matters will interest philosophers, sociologists and general historians, for whom there is no alternative introduction to the subject at this level.",

    "abstract": "If there is such a thing as essential reading in metaphysics or in philosophy of language, this is it. Ever since the publication of its original version, ’Naming and Necessity’ has had great and increasing influence. It redirected philosophical attention to neglected questions of natural and metaphysical necessity and to the connections between these and theories of reference, in particular of naming, and of identity. From a critique of the dominant tendency to assimilate names to descriptions and more generally to treat their reference as a function of their Fregean sense, surprisingly deep and widespread consequences may be drawn. The largely discredited distinction between accidental and essential properties, both of individual things (including people) and of kinds of things, is revived. So is a consequent view of science as what seeks out the essences of natural kinds. Traditional objections to such views are dealt with by sharpening distinctions between epistemic and metaphysical necessity; in particular by the startling admission of necessary a posteriori truths. From these, in particular from identity statements using rigid designators whether of things or of kinds, further remarkable consequences are drawn for the natures of things, of people, and of kinds; strong objections follow, for example to identity versions of materialism as a theory of the mind. This seminal work, to which today’s thriving essentialist metaphysics largely owes its impetus, is here published with a substantial new Preface by the author.",

    "abstract": "With the rise of science, we moderns believe, the world changed irrevocably, separating us forever from our primitive, premodern ancestors. But if we were to let go of this fond conviction, Bruno Latour asks, what would the world look like? His book, an anthropology of science, shows us how much of modernity is actually a matter of faith. What does it mean to be modern? What difference does the scientific method make? The difference, Latour explains, is in our careful distinctions between nature and society, between human and thing, distinctions that our benighted ancestors, in their world of alchemy, astrology, and phrenology, never made. But alongside this purifying practice that defines modernity, there exists another seemingly contrary one: the construction of systems that mix politics, science, technology, and nature. The ozone debate is such a hybrid, in Latour’s analysis, as are global warming, deforestation, even the idea of black holes. As these hybrids proliferate, the prospect of keeping nature and culture in their separate mental chambers becomes overwhelming–and rather than try, Latour suggests, we should rethink our distinctions, rethink the definition and constitution of modernity itself. His book offers a new explanation of science that finally recognizes the connections between nature and culture–and so, between our culture and others, past and present. Nothing short of a reworking of our mental landscape. ’We Have Never Been Modern’ blurs the boundaries among science, the humanities, and the social sciences to enhance understanding on all sides. A summation of the work of one of the most influential and provocative interpreters of science, it aims at saving what is good and valuable in modernity and replacing the rest with a broader, fairer, and finer sense of possibility.",

    "abstract": "This book gathers together for the first time an important body of texts written between 1672 and 1686 by the great German philosopher and polymath Gottfried Leibniz. These writings, most of them previously untranslated, represent Leibniz’s sustained attempt on a problem whose solution was crucial to the development of his thought, that of the composition of the continuum. The volume begins with excerpts from Leibniz’s Paris writings, in which he tackles such problems as whether the infinite division of matter entails ’perfect points,’ whether matter and space can be regarded as true wholes, whether motion is truly continuous, and the nature of body and substance. Comprising the second section is Pacidius Philalethi, Leibniz’s brilliant dialogue of late 1676 on the problem of the continuity of motion. In the selections of the final section, from his Hanover writings of 1677-1686, Leibniz abandons his earlier transcreationism and atomism in favor of the theory of corporeal substance, where the reality of body and motion is founded in substantial form or force. Leibniz’s texts (one in French, the rest in Latin) are presented with facing-page English translations, together with an introduction, notes, appendixes containing related excerpts from earlier works by Leibniz and his predecessors, and a valuable glossary detailing important terms and their translations.",

    "abstract": "This book is a defense of modal realism; the thesis that our world is but one of a plurality of worlds, and that the individuals that inhabit our world are only a few out of all the inhabitants of all the worlds. Lewis argues that the philosophical utility of modal realism is a good reason for believing that it is true. After putting forward the type of modal realism he favors, Lewis answers numerous objections that have been raised against it. These include an insistence that everything must be actual; paradoxes akin to those that confront naive set theory; arguments that modal realism leads to inductive skepticism, or to disregard for prudence and morality; and finally, sheer incredulity at a theory that disagrees so badly with common opinion. Lewis grants the weight of the last objection, but takes it to be outweighed by the benefits to systematic theory that acceptance of modal realism brings. He asks whether these same benefits might be gained more cheaply if we replace his many worlds by many merely ’abstract’ representations; but concludes that all versions of this ’ersatz modal realism’ are in serious trouble. In the final chapter, Lewis distinguishes various questions about trans-world identity, and argues that his ’method of counterparts’ is preferable to alternative approaches.",

    "abstract": "This landmark book represents the first attempt in two decades to survey the science of the ancient world, the first attempt in four decades to write a comprehensive history of medieval science, and the first attempt ever to present a full, unified account of both ancient and medieval science in a single volume. In ’The Beginnings of Western Science’, David C. Lindberg provides a rich chronicle of the development of scientific ideas, practices, and institutions from the pre-Socratic Greek philosophers to the late-medieval scholastics.Lindberg surveys all the most important themes in the history of ancient and medieval science, including developments in cosmology, astronomy, mechanics, optics, alchemy, natural history, and medicine. He synthesizes a wealth of information in superbly organized, clearly written chapters designed to serve students, scholars, and nonspecialists alike. In addition, Lindberg offers an illuminating account of the transmission of Greek science to medieval Islam and subsequently to medieval Europe. And throughout the book he pays close attention to the cultural and institutional contexts within which scientific knowledge was created and disseminated and to the ways in which the content and practice of science were influenced by interaction with philosophy and religion. Carefully selected maps, drawings, and photographs complement the text.Lindberg’s story rests on a large body of important scholarship produced by historians of science, philosophy, and religion over the past few decades. However, Lindberg does not hesitate to offer new interpretations and to hazard fresh judgments aimed at resolving long-standing historical disputes. Addressed to the general educated reader as well as to students, his book will also appeal to any scholar whose interests touch on the history of the scientific enterprise.",

Which Rationality?’ He begins by considering the cultural and philosophical distance dividing Lord Gifford’s late nineteenth-century world from our own. The outlook of that earlier world, MacIntyre claims, was definitively articulated in the Ninth Edition of the ’Encyclopaedia Brittanica’, which conceived of moral enquiry as both providing insight into and continuing the rational progress of mankind into ever greater enlightenment. MacIntyre compares that conception of moral enquiry to two rival conceptions also formulated in the late nineteenth century: that of Nietzsche’s ’Zur Genealogie der Moral’ and that expressed in the encyclical letter of Pope Leo XIII ’Aeterni Patris’. The lectures focus on Aquinas’s integration of Augustinian and Aristotelian modes of enquiry, the inability of the encyclopaedists’ standpoint to withstand Thomistic or genealogical criticism, and the problems confronting the contemporary post-Nietzschean genealogist. MacIntyre concludes by considering the implications for education in universities and colleges.",

Some topics are covered well, some pictures are nice (even though they are painted in orange and shades of black), and the History sections are interesting to read to take a break from learning multivariable calculus. Also this book contains some material typically not found in a standard calc text (e.g. Stewart). But that’s where the good stuff ends. Some topics are covered in extremely little detail, for example section on polar coordinates has one trivial example, which is common sense. However that section fails to show a better, more rigorous example of integration using them. I was unfortunate enough to have this as a textbook for my Advanced Calculus class. My frustration got to the point where I just borrowed a copy of Stewart from my friend and studied from it, because reading Marsden’s book was simply not as productive and efficient. Let’s compare this to a Multivariable Calculus (5th edition) by Stewart: Stewart’s book has much better, colored pictures. Better paper also. Smaller in physical size. Better examples.If you are stuck with this book in your course, then try to get a copy of Stewart or Salas as a supplement. Trust me on this one.",

    "abstract": "Of what nature is the mind? So Colin McGinn starts his first chapter, and this is his guiding question. He pursues the answer with a boldness and provocativeness rarely encountered in philosophical writing. As he explains, my aim has been to give the reader something definite and stimulating to think about, rather than to present a cautious and disinterested survey of the state of the subject. The Character of Mind provides a general introduction to the philosophy of mind, covering all the main topics: the mindbody problem, the nature of acquaintance, the relation between thought and language, agency, the self. In particular, Colin McGinn addresses the issue of consciousness, and the difficulty of combining the two very different perspectives on the mind that arise from introspection and from the observation of other people. His aim throughout is to identify the recalcitrant problems clearly, and to suggest fruitful approaches to their solutions, always avoiding facile answers. The second edition of this classic book adds three completely new chapters on consciousness, mental content, and cognitive science, bringing it abreast of current developments. A distinctive viewpoint is adopted, stressing consciousness, but the intention is still to come to grips with the underlying philosophical problems, accessibly articulating the deep difficulties we face in theorizing about the mind. From the reviews of the first edition: “a very good introduction to the philosophy of mind. . . . written with confidence and authority . . . a fine text for an undergraduate course.” Jonathan Lear, The Times Literary Supplement “a lucid and impressive discussion . . . to be recommended to students and professionals alike . . . brilliant book.” Brian O’Shaughnessy, London Review of Books “clear, stimulating and thought-provoking.” Bernard Harrison, Philosophy “an impressive piece of worktough, elegant, ingenious, argumentative and controversial.” Nicholas Everitt, Times Higher Educational Supplement",

    "abstract": "Werner Heisenberg’s Copenhagen interpretation of modern quantum theory has long been the majority view. It includes two theses: 1) the wave/particle duality thesis that wave and particle are two manifestations of one and the same entity, and 2) the scientific realism thesis that the theory is literally descriptive of microphysical reality.This book’s editors, Cushing (a physicist) and a Reverend McMullin (a philosopher), both members of the University of Notre Dame faculty, dissent from the majority view. Cushing rejects the Copenhagen interpretation, and the Reverend McMullin rejects the realist thesis.In 1935 Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (’EPR’) proposed a hypothetical experiment to demonstrate the present quantum theory’s incompleteness by showing that it implies action at a distance, which the three co-authors (EPR) viewed as absurd.In 1964 Bell published his locality inequality, and in 1982 Aspect, Dalibard, and Roger implemented the actual EPR experiment with an outcome that corroborated the Copenhagen interpretation by violating Bell’s inequality.Based on their articles in this book I see the Reverend McMullin as clearly the junior partner of the two editors of this book. The Reverend’s contribution is typical of his other writings - merely a recitation of some well-known pre-twentieth-century history, in this case about the idea of action at a distance.Quine once quipped that people take up philosophy either because they like philosophy or because they like history. Quine is clearly among the former, and I place the Reverend McMullin among the latter.Some of the articles are reprints, but two original works are those by the physicists Teller and Howard. They postulate ’holism.’ But holism means little to physicists except as a name for what has already been described by their experimental findings and physical theory.I believe that it is better just to let the theory speak for itself in its own terms, and to accept it as a literal and realistic description. Such scientific realism is what Quine calls ’ontological relativity.’The book’s title notwithstanding the historic philosophical consequences of quantum theory have not been discussed in this book. They are the emergence of the contemporary pragmatist philosophy of language and of science, which include the thesis of ontological relativity. The two editors seem to me to bring a nineteenth-century philosophy to quantum theory.Google my book titled History of Twentieth-Century Philosophy of Science at my web site philsci with free downloads by chapter.Thomas J.

    "abstract": "Evil threatens human reason, for it challenges our hope that the world makes sense. For eighteenth-century Europeans, the Lisbon earthquake was manifest evil. Today we view evil as a matter of human cruelty, and Auschwitz as its extreme incarnation. Examining our understanding of evil from the Inquisition to contemporary terrorism, Susan Neiman explores who we have become in the three centuries that separate us from the early Enlightenment. In the process, she rewrites the history of modern thought and points philosophy back to the questions that originally animated it. Whether expressed in theological or secular terms, evil poses a problem about the world’s intelligibility. It confronts philosophy with fundamental questions: Can there be meaning in a world where innocents suffer? Can belief in divine power or human progress survive a cataloging of evil? Is evil profound or banal? Neiman argues that these questions impelled modern philosophy. Traditional philosophers from Leibniz to Hegel sought to defend the Creator of a world containing evil. Inevitably, their efforts–combined with those of more literary figures like Pope, Voltaire, and the Marquis de Sade–eroded belief in God’s benevolence, power, and relevance, until Nietzsche claimed He had been murdered. They also yielded the distinction between natural and moral evil that we now take for granted. Neiman turns to consider philosophy’s response to the Holocaust as a final moral evil, concluding that two basic stances run through modern thought. One, from Rousseau to Arendt, insists that morality demands we make evil intelligible. The other, from Voltaire to Adorno, insists that morality demands that we don’t. Beautifully written and thoroughly engaging, this book tells the history of modern philosophy as an attempt to come to terms with evil. It reintroduces philosophy to anyone interested in questions of life and death, good and evil, suffering and sense.",

How is it that we feel confident in generalizing from experience in some ways but not in others? How ore generalizations that ore warranted to be distinguished from those that are not? Goodman shows that these questions resist formal solution and his demonstration has been taken by nativists like Chomsky and Fodor as proof that neither scientific induction nor ordinary learning can proceed without an a ’priori’, or innate, ordering of hypotheses. In his new foreword to this edition, Hilary Putnam forcefully rejects these nativist claims. The controversy surrounding these unsolved problems is as relevant to the psychology of cognitive development as it is to the philosophy of science.

Philosophers, psychologists, linguists, and educators raise serious questions about the viability of the traditional distinction between the literal and the metaphorical, discussing problems ranging from the definition of metaphor to its role in language acquistion, learning, scientific thinking, and the creation of social policy. In the second edition, the contributors have updated their original essays to reflect changes in their fields. The volume also includes six new chapters that present important and influential new ideas about metaphor that have appeared in such fields as the philosophy of language and the philosophy of science, linguistics, cognitive and clinical psychology, education, and artificial intelligence. The book will serve as an excellent graduate-level textbook in cognitive psychology, linguistics, and artificial intelligence.",

Hempel and Paul Oppenheim, ’Studies in the Logic of Explanation,‚Äù which introduced the deductive-nomological (D-N) model on which most work on scientific explanation was based for the following four decades, Salmon goes beyond this model’s inherent basis of describing empirical knowledge to tells us ‚Äúnot only ’what,’ but also ’why’.‚Äù Salmon examines the predominant models in chronological order and describes their development, refinement, and criticism or rejection.’Four Decades of Scientific Explanation’ underscores the need for a consensus of approach and ongoing evaluations of methodology in scientific explanation, with the goal of providing a better understanding of natural phenomena.",

Kim Sterelny aims to introduce people to this area of philosophy be exemplifying it, to show that philosophical and empirical investigations can be synthesized to the benefit of both. It is both introduction and argument, explanation and manifesto and succeeds in bridging the widening gap between student primer and contemporary research.

    "abstract": "In this extensive inquiry into the sources of modern selfhood, Charles Taylor demonstrates just how rich and precious those resources are. The modern turn to subjectivity, with its attendant rejection of an objective order of reason, has led–it seems to many–to ’mere’ subjectivism at the mildest and to sheer nihilism at the worst. Many critics believe that the modern order has no moral backbone and has proved corrosive to all that might foster human good. Taylor rejects this view. He argues that, properly understood, our modern notion of the self provides a framework that more than compensates for the abandonment of substantive notions of rationality. The major insight of ’Sources of the Self’ is that modern subjectivity, in all its epistemological, aesthetic, and political ramifications, has its roots in ideas of human good. After first arguing that contemporary philosophers have ignored how self and good connect, the author defines the modern identity by describing its genesis. His effort to uncover and map our moral sources leads to novel interpretations of most of the figures and movements in the modern tradition. Taylor shows that the modern turn inward is not disastrous but is in fact the result of our long efforts to define and reach the good. At the heart of this definition he finds what he calls the affirmation of ordinary life, a value which has decisively if not completely replaced an older conception of reason as connected to a hierarchy based on birth and wealth. In telling the story of a revolution whose proponents have been Augustine, Montaigne, Luther, and a host of others, Taylor’s goal is in part to make sure we do not lose sight of their goal and endanger all that has been achieved. ’Sources of the Self’ provides a decisive defense of the modern order and a sharp rebuff to its critics.",

I won’t bore you stiff by addressing every blatant error in this book: it will suffice to say that our Prof. Disney has, single-handedly, come up with an entirely new successor to Prince Frederick-Henry of Orange (1584 - 1647): a certain Henry III. All it takes is a monkey (Descartes would have loved that) with a computer, to google himself to enlightenment: that the good prince Frederick Henry was in fact succeeded by his son William II, who was succeeded by his son, William III, Prince of Orange and King of England, Schotland and Ireland. ’Elementary, my dear Watson’. (And no, Richard: Descartes didn’t meet Huygens in 1630, they first met in 1635, and no, no, Richard: ’Stadhouder’ is not quite the same as ’Commander-in-Chief’, and no, no, no, Richard: Constantijn Huygens served two, not three Stadhouders as first secretary, etc. etc.).

In Part II, Coffa chronicles the development of this tradition by members and associates of the Vienna Circle. Much of Coffa’s analysis draws on the unpublished notes and correspondence of many philosophers. The book, however, is not merely a history of the semantic tradition from Kant ’to the Vienna Station.’ Coffa also critically reassesses the role of semantic notions in understanding the ground of a priori knowledge and its relation to empirical knowledge and questions the turn the tradition has taken since Vienna.",

    "abstract": "Written by one of the century’s truly great thinkers, Ludwig Wittgenstein’s ’Philosophical Investigations’ is a remarkable–and surprisingly approachable–collection of insights, statements, and nearly displayed thinking habits of the philosopher’s work on language, symbols, categories, and a host of other topics. Organized into nearly 700 short observations, this book is a treasure trove for anyone who needs to think carefully about objects, categories, and symbols, especially in relation to structured logic applications in computer programming. The short (and sometimes aphoristic) observations in ’Philosophical Investigations’ allow the reader to ponder basic questions on what describes a category, how language works in everyday situations, and how symbols function to represent our world. Originally a series of notes to himself as he lectured on philosophy, the book is a brilliant grab bag of thought and example. Often framed as a question (’How do I recognize that this is red?’), the philosopher provides short answers in a sentence or two, never more than a paragraph. (The second part of the book uses longer answers of several pages to develop its arguments.) An index lets the reader browse on topics of interest–such as language, concept, games, or naming. Any artificial intelligence researcher looking to understand human language will be intrigued by Wittgenstein’s ideas on how symbols and language operate. And for anyone who designs software with objects, this book’s careful attention to thinking about what makes a good category demonstrates rigorous thinking about everyday objects and things. ’Philosophical Investigations’ is at times a strange and often wonderful book that reveals the thought processes of one of history’s finest minds. It exposes the fundamental problems of using language as a means of teaching machines to ’think’ using words. ’–Richard Dragan’ Topics covered: Theory of language and language games, meaning and symbols, concepts and categories, behavior, games (including chess), color, images and perception, grammar and language, sensations, theory of mind and thinking.",

    "abstract": "For thousands of years, people have used nature to justify their political, moral, and social judgments. Such appeals to the moral authority of nature are still very much with us today, as heated debates over genetically modified organisms and human cloning testify.The Moral Authority of Nature offers a wide-ranging account of how people have used nature to think about what counts as good, beautiful, just, or valuable. The eighteen essays cover a diverse array of topics, including the connection of cosmic and human orders in ancient Greece, medieval notions of sexual disorder, early modern contexts for categorizing individuals and judging acts as \"against nature,\" race and the origin of humans, ecological economics, and radical feminism. The essays also range widely in time and place, from archaic Greece to early twentieth-century China, medieval Europe to contemporary America.Scholars from a wide variety of fields will welcome The Moral Authority of Nature, which provides the first sustained historical survey of its topic.Contributors: Danielle Allen, Joan Cadden, Lorraine Daston, Fa-ti Fan, Eckhardt Fuchs, Valentin Groebner, Abigail J.

    "abstract": "Before publishing his landmark Meditations in 1641, Rene Descartes sent his manuscript to many leading thinkers to solicit their objections to his arguments. He included these objections, along with his own detailed replies, as part of the first edition. This unusual strategy gave Descartes a chance to address criticisms in advance and to demonstrate his willingness to consider diverse viewpoints—critical in an age when radical ideas could result in condemnation by church and state, or even death.Descartes and his Contemporaries recreates the tumultuous intellectual community of seventeenth-century Europe and provides a detailed, modern analysis of the Meditations in its historical context. The book’s chapters examine the arguments and positions of each of the objectors—Hobbes, Gassendi, Arnauld, Morin, Caterus, Bourdin, and others whose views were compiled by Mersenne. They illuminate Descartes’ relationships to the scholastics and particularly the Jesuits, to Mersenne’s circle with its debates about the natural sciences, to the Epicurean movements of his day, and to the Augustinian tradition. Providing a glimpse of the interactions among leading 17th-century intellectuals as they grappled with major philosophical issues, this book sheds light on how Descartes’ thought developed and was articulated in opposition to the ideas of his contemporaries.",

Rather he relies heavily on analogies to simple mechanical devices to infer similar mechanical principles at work in the <i>cosmos</i>cosmos at large. Descartes’ even admits to having been inspired by the study of machines in developing his mechanistic explanation of what goes on at the microscopic level of bodies.Hattab’s article makes clear, if not explictly, that discussion regarding the status of mechanics took place in the context of \"subalternation\"!! Lots of quotes here. Easily found. Talk of \"borrowing\" principles, \"being subordinate\", \"part of\", etc. follow pink underlines.",

    "annote": "Naturalisms in different philosophical arenas should be kept distinct, at least on first consideration. Moreover, Naturalism is opposed to a variety of views, some ontological, some epistemological, some semantic, some concerning justifications, etc. Audi offers the following criteria for determining whether a philosophical position in naturalized, and to what extent: a) <i>Scope</i>. How wide is the targe category—the object to be naturalized? (i.e., the normative, the abstract, the supernatural). This category can be naturalized either <i>directly</i>, by elimination, or indirectly, by a reconstructive reduction which preserves a good deal of our discourse about the naturalized category, except that it now lacks those features that had rendered it un-natural. b) <i>Strength</i>. Considerations of strength rest of <i>Modality</i>, <i>Reductivity</i>, and <i>Compositionality</i>. Modality is the nature of the naturalization: is it analytic, a priori, nomic, etc. Reductivity concerns whether the non-natural phenomena are claimed to be identical to natural ones, supervienient on, dependent on, etc. Compositionality: don’t quite get this one “the degree to which a naturalization project takes the target category into physical constituents or, less commonly, into something else supposed to be more natural than the target category”. c) <i>Motivation</i>. Is the motivation ontological, methodological or epistemological? Audi details attempts at naturalizing Metaphysics, Epistemology and Ethics. The last section is interesting (p. 40), where he treats the interrelations between these domains.",

Discussion about the correlatives argument, separating fields of study. The problem seems to be that De Anima subsumes the soul into the study of nature, while Parts of Animals makes clear that certain parts of the soul, the intellect, is not part of the study of nature. The solution is the “teleological perspective\" according to which the study of any thing presupposes the end to which that thing is directed. So with the human animal, a knowledge of its end—intellectual activity—is required for the study of its animal being. These seem initially at odds to me, but Broadie spend some time showing they are not. A large theme of the paper concerns the role of the investigator as having the same nous as the objects of his study, and I don’t understand the importance, which Broadie signifies is large.",

The goal is stated as i) the causes and definition of coming to be and passing away of things which come to be and pass away by nature—all of them alike. ii) what growth and alteration are, and iii) whether alteration differs from coming to be <i>simpliciter</i>simpliciter. Burnyeat’s question is why the discussion focuses on the elements when it is supposed to apply to all those things that are generated. Previous commentators (Joachim) held that Aristotle <i>intends</i>intends to deal with elements only, but according to Burnyeat this suggests a reduction that is not to be found in Aristotle (Why need forms if generation is reducible to elements?) and flies against the proclamation of the text. Evidence from <i>De Sensu</i>De Sensu and <i>De Anima</i>De Anima and <i>Physics</i>Physics show that the same theory of generation is assumed in those locations, and its subject matter is substantial change, not only elemental change. Further evidence is advanced regarding the architectonic nature of Aristotle’s writings, particularly that knowledge of the biological domain comes after and depends upon knowledge of <i>physics, de caelo, de gen</i>physics, de caelo, de gen, and <i>meteorologica</i>meteorologica, thus the theory of the elements should be significant for the whole of Aristotle’s philosophy of nature. The remainder of the essay concern 3 senses of the word foundational: physical foundations, conceptual foundations, and teleological foundations, and the way in which GC is foundational to Aristotle’s enterprise.(1) <i>Physical Foundations</i>Physical Foundations. Burnyeat considers the study of the elements foundational in that the elements are the physical components of sublunary life. GC and <i>De Caelo</i>De Caelo are methodologically unique because they “pincer\" Aristotle’s investigation, constituting the top and bottom of his universe. <i>De Caelo</i>De Caelo is presented in a hypothetical, yet deductively rigorous style, combining necessity and epistemic modesty. This is because knowledge of the heavens is limited, and must consist in deduction from dubitable first principles. GC is methodologically unique in a different way. Here, knowledge of the concept (like coming to be, growth, mixture, etc.) are very well known, so the truth must be sorted out by relentless dialectic\". GC also presupposes earlier discussion, particularly the discussion of contant in <i>Physics</i>Physics V. 2, as change occurs through contact.(2) <i>Conceptual Foundations.</i>Conceptual Foundations. In GC Aristotle refers to the topics of the <i>Physics</i>Physics as earlier. In what sense? A logical sense, and the order of proper learning.(3) Teleological Foundation. Burnyeat suggests that the conceptual order of treatises should also indicate that their end is their goal. Understanding life is the goal towards which the rest of the Aristotelian corpus is developed. I didn’t read this section carefully, the discussion boils down to invoking intelligible matter.

Against this view I will argue that Read did not have any quarrel at all with unobservable or theoretical entities as such, and that his objections against actual theories concerning ether were scientific rather than philosophical, even when based on Newton’s first rule. I argue further that Reid’s insistence on Newton’s rule concerns, not direct observation, but rather the notion of explanation itself.",

    "annote": "In all studies during the present century one may detect an underlying asumption that Galileo wrote his <i>Dialogue</i>Dialogue as an ardent Copernican who allowd that burning conviction to affect his scientific judgment. Drake no longer accept this assumption. Accepting this assumption leads to the opinions of Wallace and McMullin, who portray Galileo as a sophisticated philosopher, which Drake believes he is not. Drake pushed the H-D method throughout, and suggests that Galileo felt no conflict with the church because he saw his own reasoning as merely probably. Also, the key to understanding Galileo’s physics in the second day is to view it purely kinematically. Drake holds that contradictions only arise if Galileo is straddled with impetus or inertia (circular or otherwise) notions. The only conservation principle attributed to him should be conservation of speed. Moreover, Drake holds these interpretations results from viewing Galileo as an overzealous Copernican. I’m not sure if contradictions disappear with kinematics, or how Copernicanism promotes dynamism. Galileo Copernicanism results from his tidal theory, not the other way around.The argument relies on “oddities”oddities associated with the first printing in 1632:The first sentence of the title does not make any reference to the World Systems. It only lists Galileo, the Duke, etc. Only the second full sentence mentions the systems. At the trial, the book was only referred to by the first sentence. Moreover, the book does not promise any astronomical reasons, only physical and philosophical.The preface calls attention to the 1616 regulation of books on Copernicanism, which Galileo had previously battled against.The general statements about the overall purpose of the dialogue are at odds with one another. In the preface, it is to discuss “wonders of heaven and earth”wonders of heaven and earth. In the beginning of the first day, it is the Ptolmeic vs. Copernican system. At the end of the fourth day, it is tides (which are only mentioned before in the middle of the second day, but with a note that this is a subject of much consequence).Nice quote from Riccardi regarding his take on the purpose of the book, citing hypothetical and merely mathematical reasoning. Riccardi edited Galileo’s the preface, which accounts for oddity 2 above. Corpernicanism gets pushed to the front of the preface not because Galileo intended it to, but because discussion of the tides had to be pushed later (since the title was not allowed to be on tides).Drake notes that if Galileo was suspicious at all of possible prohibition of the book, it is unlikely he would have undertaken it (being already 60!). Instead, he obeys the 1616 edict (which was fair to astronomers and did not disallow all use of the copernican hypothesis) and uses reasoning <i>ex suppositione</i>ex suppositione.Simplicio attacks Galileo’s <i>ex sup</i>ex sup reasoning as a <i>petitio principi</i>petitio principi: basing an explanation of the tides on a supposition which the explanation is supposed to confirm. Moreoever, why aren’t tides observed in air, which, like water, is not rigidly tied to the Earth? Galileo never answers this charge.Drake speculates that this is because Galileo anticipated that the charge would be leveled from philosophic quarters, and he was concerned with convincing the common man, who would not have cared for such subtleties. Drake notes his disagreement with Wallace and McMullin that Galileo paid attention to fine philosophical debates, pinning their misinterpretation on the assumption that Galileo was an overzealous Copernican.As for the nature of Galileo’s physics:",

    "annote": "More on the idea of discrete impetus theories, focusing on Fabri’s mathematized theory and his response to Galileo. See (<b>Drak75?</b>) for the heart of the historical thesis. The essay concerns the conflict between two thesis: that speeds of fall are proportional to distance, or to time. Drake argues that there was no conflict between these prior to Galileo. The miscontrual is based on a misinterpretation of Albert of Saxony’s version of the speed-distance rule. In fact, there was no precise rule in Albert: “there was an inherent indeterminacy in the imperus theory of free fall which made it impossible to assign a unique time or place in free fall from rest for any one “degree of speed”. The impetus theory was intended to provide a causal explanation of fall. A reconstruction of Galileo’s law of free fall was given by Baliani and Fabri in the mid 1600s, basing it on a “deeper” law. Drake claims that both based their law on Buridan’s impetus theory.",

Drake argues this was not an oversight, but that conceiving of speed as non-continuous means that the continuous mean speed theorem cannot be applied. The argument is based on a reading of Buridan’s impetus theory.Why was the mean speed theorem (showing speeds proportional to times) not applied to impetus theory?

Drake argues this was not an oversight, but that conceiving of speed as non-continuous means that the continuous mean speed theorem cannot be applied. The argument is based on a reading of Buridan’s impetus theory.Put another way, there was an incompatibility between impetus theories and a continuous view of speed. Drake claims his interpretation explains why several of Galileo’s successors (notably Descartes) rejected the idea that a body from rest passes though all degrees of speed, and an event in 1543.Medieval writers made a distinction between entities that could be present all at once, and those that had to be “spread out”spread out.The concept on an instant was certainly known before Galileo. Aristotle used it in regutation of motion in a void, holding that such motion would be instantaneous and thus impossible. Similar problem with instants occured elsewhere. In the case of the <i>punctum reflexionis</i>punctum reflexionis, if stoping and starting occured in one instant, then there would be a contradition (a body being both at rest and in motion).Drake notes that the latin for degree (gradus) connoted gradations, i.e., discontinuous quantities.Jean Buridan coined the term impetus for the left-over force (<i>vis derelicta</i>vis derelicta) left in a projectile after it left the thrower. He held that this force was “permanent”permanent, and this is usually taken to indicate a prescient inertia theory, where the inherent impetus can only be removed through external impediments (like the medium). However, Drake would like to urge that this “permanent”permanent should be understood as “present”present (this relies on his earlier discussion of permeo – i.e., permeating, not permanent). He cites Clagett’s translation of Buridan.",

    "abstract": "Before publishing his landmark Meditations in 1641, Rene Descartes sent his manuscript to many leading thinkers to solicit their objections to his arguments. He included these objections, along with his own detailed replies, as part of the first edition. This unusual strategy gave Descartes a chance to address criticisms in advance and to demonstrate his willingness to consider diverse viewpoints—critical in an age when radical ideas could result in condemnation by church and state, or even death.Descartes and his Contemporaries recreates the tumultuous intellectual community of seventeenth-century Europe and provides a detailed, modern analysis of the Meditations in its historical context. The book’s chapters examine the arguments and positions of each of the objectors—Hobbes, Gassendi, Arnauld, Morin, Caterus, Bourdin, and others whose views were compiled by Mersenne. They illuminate Descartes’ relationships to the scholastics and particularly the Jesuits, to Mersenne’s circle with its debates about the natural sciences, to the Epicurean movements of his day, and to the Augustinian tradition. Providing a glimpse of the interactions among leading 17th-century intellectuals as they grappled with major philosophical issues, this book sheds light on how Descartes’ thought developed and was articulated in opposition to the ideas of his contemporaries.",

    "annote": "Leibniz brings together the conception of Bacon and Descartes regarding the unity of the sciences. In Bacon, “the limits [on the unity of science] are not fixed, however, by the theory of knowledge [as in Aristotle, scholastics, etc.!] but by religion, which sharply separates itslef from science, and having done so, declares what is to be reserved to tis own jusidiction” (p. 27). This conception has it the <i>all</i> science, by which he means any product of rational thought, must have as its purview the natural world. Metaphysics, therefore, which is a science, must also be about the natural world, it must be “a part of Physic”. McRae continues to examine ethics, politics; in characteristic style, he is either all over the place, or I just don’t get him.... Any science, however, is merely a reflection of the natural order. Since nature is unified (story about God, creation, Laws, etc.), so must be the sciences. In <i>De Augmentis Scientiarum</i>, Bacon offers the image of a tree (Bk I, ch. xiii, in Works VIII, 449), whose trunk is Philosophia Prima and is composed of axioms which are “the footsteps of nature”.\nBacon parts with the Aristotelian conception of the separation of sciences according to their subject matter (i.e., genus) by holding that it is necessary for science to have “intercourse” with one another and that “the particulars and instances of one science” supply information for the “framing or correcting of the axioms of another scinece in their very truth and notion” (from Valerius Terminus, ch. I). Logic is also able to critique the principles of any science. Sciences differ from one another only in generality, since all are based on induction from particularlys: they differ only in their level of generality.\nFor McRae the contrast between Bacon and Descartes is that Bacon grounds the unity of science in Nature, while Descartes grounds it in the Mind. First, Descartes opposes the division of the science according to subject matter and hold that this is only the case for practical arts, whose methods are appropriate to their subject matter. It is by training on certain subject that the mind becomes accustomed to solving problems in other subjects. The most fruitful of concentrations is mathematics. McRae notes that Descartes distinguishes science from the “Mechanical Arts”. What’s up here? Continues in the same way, not very informative, historically awful, with no sustained focus on any single work: great example of cherry-picking historiography.",

She considers in detail his friendships, particularly with Isaac Beeckman and Marin Mersenne. Primarily on the basis of his private correspondence, Rodis-Lewis gives a thorough and balanced discussion of his personality. The Descartes she depicts is by turns generous and unforgiving, arrogant and open-minded, loyal in his friendships but eager for the isolation his work required.\" “Drawing on Descartes’s writings and his public and private correspondence, she corrects the errors of earlier biographies and clarifies many obscure episodes in the philosopher’s life.\"–BOOK JACKET.",

    "annote": "His recounting of the emergence of the epistemological problematic in philosophy follows the historiographical traditions of Gilson and Randal. Rorty writes:Descartes is dimly envisaging a similarity between the “simple natures”simple natures which we know in mathematical physics... and the colors themselves. Colors, in his official, Galilean, metaphysical view, are secondary qualities waiting upon analysis into simples, but epistemologically they seem, like pain, to have the same sort of primitive inescapability as the simple natures themselves. He could not make the analogy explicit without setting his foot on the road toward Lockean empiricism. But neither could he give it up without falling back into the old Aristotelian distinction between the sensitive and the intellectual souls. This would have brought back all the pre-Galilean metaphysics which he wanted to avoid, not to mention a hylomorphic empistemology impossibly difficult to reconcile with the explanatory power of Galilean mechanics. (p.57)Even better:The hylomorphic epistemology which thought of grasping universals as instancing in one’s intellect what the fron instanced in its flesh was, thanks to the rise of mathematical physics, being replaced by a law-event framework which explained froghood as possible a merely “nominal”nominal essence. So the notion of reason as a faculty of grasping universals was not available for use in a premise proving the distinctness of the mind from the body. The notion which would define what could “have a distinct exitence from the body”have a distinct exitence from the body was one which would draw a line between the cramps in one’s stomach and the associated feeling in one’s mind (p.62)andBut precisely this notion of one big substance [i.e., extension] was what was needed to provide a “philosophical foundation”philosophical foundation of Galilean mechanics while heaping scorn on traditional hylomorphic explanations. (p.65)In this context, Rorty cites Burtt, who in Chap IV of <i>Metaphysical Foundations</i>Metaphysical Foundations holds that the criteria of reality for Descartes is not permanence but the possibility of mathematical handling.",

    "annote": "As usual, erudiate article. Nice discussion of Huygens, although he casts his claims in modern phrasing, and I believe is missing part of the discussion, especially in the discussion of Huygens’ concept of mass. I believe casting these claims in the language of proportionality may make Stein thesis—that Huygens’ had a full-blown concept of weight—less strong. First segment of the paper focuses on Huygnes, his law of conservation of motion, the treatment of impact and centrifugal force. Very nice exposition on all three. A short discussion of the difference between Huygens’ and Newton, refering to the early optical correspondece. The focus there is whether explanatory categories are “primary” in the causal sense (i.e., “original”), or not. This is the sequeway to Locke, with the claim that in the first edition of the Essay, this causal definition of primary qualities is more pronounced than a later resemblance-based definition. The remainder of the article is a comparison of Locke and Newton. The main points are:\n1. ‘The qualities Locke calls primary and original constitute a fixed list; it is clear that Newton’s usage is more flexible–like the properties he discovers of light.\n2. the primary qualities of Locke correspond, in principle, to a subset of “the simple Ideas we receive from Sensation and Reflection”. The properties called primary by Newton are, on the contrary, of the class that Locke calls secondary Qualities, mediately perceivable. ***p. 31ff. is a discussion of the nature of certain Knowledge, Stein makes the claim that although Locke denies the very possibility of a scientific natural philosophy, all the exception to this are passsages in which Locke refers explicitly to Newton. He supplies examples.\n3. The third difference is between two different concpetion of what is required for a systematic science from an epistemological pov. There is a somewhat circumlocutious discussion, hitting on the main points, but worth returning to.\n4. There is a difference in metaphysics itself (rather than its epistemic ground). Stein discussion of De Grav here, concerning substance and its creation, and the claim that Newton totally rejects the notion of substance, while Locke merely holds it to be unintelligible, and a return to some of the epistemic issues.\n5. Concerning first principles, Newton does not fold, like Aristotle, Huygens, etc. that first principles are determined in a process that precedes science, but are part of the scientific investigation itself.",

Henry divides the “real sciences\" into natural and abstractive. The natural sciences (also, physics) divide into natural philosophy and medicine and it is these “that by investigating takes under consideration the causes of things in their effects and the effects from their causes, and it derives its name from “physics” in Greek, which is “nature” in Latin\" (p.253). The fact that Henry places physics and mathematics on two separate branching of the <i>arbor</i> and that he does not stress the role mathematics plays in physics puts him squarely in teh tradition of thirteenth-century Aristotelian’s such as Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas and at odds with the Oxford Platonic tradition of Robert Grosseteste, Robert Kilwardby, and Roger Bacon. A list of middle sciences that includes science of weights. p.254 of this essay is useful. NB: the middle sciences are not defined metaphysically, but by the statement that they apply mathematics to “particular problems\"",

Also uses Hume on induction to introduce the idea that certain of our beliefs are closed off to reason and are arrived at simply because of the things we are, simply because of our nature (think induction and habits). He ends up with a position that is similar to McDowell’s, urging us to admit that, by nature, we must accept items into our mental landscape that a strict reductionism to the physical sciences would disallow. It is different from McDowell, I think, because he still believes that such items are closed off from reason, whereas McDowell wants to expand the scope of reason to reach them. This is from a 15 minute reading.",

Against the Platonists, it has become clear through the work of Tom Settle, and then Drake, etc. that Galileo had actually run experiments with fairly reasonable results. The argument against H-Dism is more complicated. Certainly, the intuition behind the method was available to Galileo. However, the method was not thought to yield certain result by Galileo’s contemporaries (and Galileo does not seem to use terms like demonstration, proof, etc. any differently than his contemporaries). Nevertheless, Galileo claimed that his method yielded certainty. Wallace third possibility is that the method used was <i>Ex Suppositione.</i>Ex Suppositione. Curiously, the terms was not used synonymously with <i>ex hypothesi</i>ex hypothesi, although it is a direct translation of the greek phrase. The latter phrase was used in a positivistic manner, to refer to proposition meant to “save the phenomena”save the phenomena.<b>Methodology of Demonstration</b><b>Methodology of Demonstration</b>Methodology of Demonstration The use of <i>ex sup</i>ex sup stems from Aquinas, who dealing with the problem of establishing necessary causes in a world of change, suggests that necessary connection can be discovered only by demonstrations <i>ex sup</i>ex sup. The <i>suppositione</i>suppositione is an effect that is caused <i>in general</i>in general, i.e., through what is thought to be proper functioning. From this effect, the causes can be known, although the effect as such may not always obtain in nature.<b>Early Notebooks</b><b>Early Notebooks</b>Early Notebooks Galileo’s notebooks, as well as notes taken by his students show that he was aware of the Aristotelian method, and particularly concerned with the <i>Posterior Analytics</i>Posterior Analytics, etc. Wallace pins the argument on Galileo’s use of Clavius’ commentary of <i>The Sphere</i>The Sphere in taught courses. Clavius was a champion of apodictic proof and argued that astronomy was concerned with finding true motions, not saving the phenomena. Nice quote here from a letter to Vinta in 1610 concerning Galileo’s life projects: he mentions the dialogo and discorsi. Anyway, Galileo distinguishes between the positivist and realist version of <i>ex sup.</i>ex sup. The terms itself is used twice in the <i>discorsi</i>discorsi and twice more in letters concerning it.",

    "annote": "The terms <i>causa</i>causa and <i>vis</i>vis were used to designate both external and internal causes in the $13^thth$ and $14^thth$ centuries. The latter use resurfaced in the $16^thth$ century, perhaps because of the translation in 1539 and 1558 for Philoponus. The distinction is crucial, since Philopanus explicitly introduces the term form, calling nature a <i>quaedam vis</i>quaedam vis (instead of only a <i>principium et causa</i>principium et causa), which is diffused throughout bodies. Galileo treats “nature”nature in this way, but does not attack the metaphysics of how it actually causes motion. Wallace focuses on the writing of Muzio Vitelleschi, A Jesuit and the Collegio Remano, who attacked this question. A more detailed analysis is contained in (<b>Galil&Wall77?</b>).In general, the essay does not discuss the <i>anima munidi</i>anima munidi tradition or platonic influences. However, Wallace takes this to be important first because it gets codified in the Coimbra commentaries and second because it is almost identical with the metaphysics endorsed by Mertonian and <i>Parisienses</i>Parisienses in the $14^thth$ century. Moreover, Galileo attended Vitelleschi’s lectures and took notes.<b>Nature as a Cause or Force</b><b>Nature as a Cause or Force</b>Nature as a Cause or ForceAlthough Vitelleschi is worried that force as an inherent cause may have pantheistic implications, he uses the concept extensively: nature is an internal principle, propensity, virtue, quality, or force for their proper motion. Is this to be considered an efficient cause?Motion is natural if it proceeds from the inclination of a body. It is violent if it is imposed from the outside and the body does not contribute any force to it; moreover, the external cause must be contrary to the body’s internal inclination. However, the inherent cause of motion can be perceived passively alone. It must be initiated by another internal principle, which is the body’s substantial form. This is the efficient form, although it is not a proper one, but one that acts by emenation.in the very process of its motion the element is further in potency [there is the potency of the substantial form itself and the potency of removing impediments] to its particular terminus or natural place, and this last potency is activated by its motive force or quality as an instrument, but in this case the active principle from which the motive quality flows is the substantial form of the element.(p.403)Aristotle did not mention this type of cause in his discussion of motion because it is not a proper efficient cause and because he was only interested in causality from without.There are 3 causal sequences in the fall of a body: 1) when impediment are removed, the element is moved by its substantial form as an agent. 2) the entire element (not just the form) moves the surrounding medium, and it the efficient cause of this motion. 3) as the medium moves, it removes more impediments.<b>Motive Forces</b><b>Motive Forces</b>Motive Forces Motive qualities or forces are either natural or impressed. Are the natural qualities primary, or do they arrise from other qualities of bodies? To this question Vit has a three-fold answer... Another question is whether these are distinct between, say, earth and water, which both move downwards. Vit holds that they are, both because of differing termini and differing speed. The story here is interesting, although a little complex. A third question is what happens to the power (and the motion itself) when the bodies are in their proper places. Vit holds the property does not go away, but remains in “first act”first act.",

    "annote": "Hylomorphism is the view that the relation of the soul to body bears some illuminating resemblance to the relation of form to matter. Discussion begins with the bronze sphere, the same example that is used to motivate many discussion of the subaltern sciences! The first difficulty is what count as “matter” of a living thing. It cannot simply be “body”, given the tangle of difficulties about a body’s being potentially alive presented in Met. Zeta and De Anima. Similarly, it cannot be “flesh and bone”. Williams suggests that we ought to think of “Body” as the matter for a “living body” of a “living animal”. Problems with this account is that “Body” looks remarkably like ’body’ and that mental functions are assigned to a conglomerate of body and soul. The conjunction of this leads to a very deflationary view, which suggests that Kallias is indentified not with his “Body”, but his “body”, and this is precisely the point which Aristotle stresses is not the case. Implication regarding fields of study is given on p. 195. Williams continues to list ways in which hylomorphism is unstatsfactory, wavering between dualism and materialism.",

The bottom line: Descartes’ uses “mechanics” in the historically appropriate way, as a discipline that has been relegated to the mathematicians, but it part of natural philosophy in general.

Descartes’ distinction between analytic/synthetic are offered in the Second Replies. Gueroult interprets this distinction as corresponding to the one in the Regulae between the order of knowing and the order of being. However, Gueroult interpretation does not make sense of the texts. The Principles and the Meditation are alike in overall order: both begin with doubt, move to god, and continue to the natural world.Edwin Curley begins offers a different interpretation, starting with the idea that we can learn most about Descartes’ use of synthesis by looking comparing the Second Replies and the Principles. Certain similarities can be found: use of definitions, formal principles, and the lack of heuristic, false-start arguments that are used in the Meditations.But neither of these approaches establish that Descartes really saw the Principles as a synthetic work! In fact, Descartes could have refered to the Principles as synthetic on many occasions, but he did not. Garber lists such occasions. Ultimately, Garber concludes that the analytic/synthetic distinction does not matter for understanding the Principles. The argument is convincing, although not air-tight.",

Analysis of the anaclastic line and the rainbox example. However, Descartes stops using the method explicitly after 1637. Garber disagrees with those who claim that the Meditations in an instance of Descartes’ old method. But why did Descartes abandon the method?Garber gives two reasons. First, since the method was based on the interconnectedness of knowledge, the project of building a systematic philosophy becomes more and more important. Second, the method is built on intuition and deduction. But how do we know that these lead to truth? The method itself must be based in something deeper, in a metaphysics.I think that Garber ignores that failures of the method. The method is also based on a representational theory of mind, and on the grasp of simple natures that are easily intuited and imagined. Once Descartes discovers that we can no longer imagine all the concepts that may be useful for us (such as a negative root), he’s got to rethink the theory of mind, and the theory of mind needs to take with it the whole of method. If anything of the method remains, it is only in very broad terms, of breaking problems into smaller chunks, etc. It is the very detailed method of the Regulae.",

    "abstract": "Before publishing his landmark Meditations in 1641, Rene Descartes sent his manuscript to many leading thinkers to solicit their objections to his arguments. He included these objections, along with his own detailed replies, as part of the first edition. This unusual strategy gave Descartes a chance to address criticisms in advance and to demonstrate his willingness to consider diverse viewpoints—critical in an age when radical ideas could result in condemnation by church and state, or even death.Descartes and his Contemporaries recreates the tumultuous intellectual community of seventeenth-century Europe and provides a detailed, modern analysis of the Meditations in its historical context. The book’s chapters examine the arguments and positions of each of the objectors—Hobbes, Gassendi, Arnauld, Morin, Caterus, Bourdin, and others whose views were compiled by Mersenne. They illuminate Descartes’ relationships to the scholastics and particularly the Jesuits, to Mersenne’s circle with its debates about the natural sciences, to the Epicurean movements of his day, and to the Augustinian tradition. Providing a glimpse of the interactions among leading 17th-century intellectuals as they grappled with major philosophical issues, this book sheds light on how Descartes’ thought developed and was articulated in opposition to the ideas of his contemporaries.",
    "annote": "Morin was Descartes’ intended target in the geometrical portion of the second replies. This is because Morin published a proof of the existence of god in a geometrical style in 1636.Morin was a conservative, but of an open-minded sort. Lots of details regarding Morin’s book and the exchanges with DescartesPunchline: Descartes was displeased with synthesis as a method of metaphysics. He wants to show that Morin is misguided by constructing his own synthetical method, but with a curious set of postulates.Garber’s ultimate point is that analysis/synthesis is less relevant to understanding Descartes philosophical method.",

    "annote": "Half of the essay is devoted to the issue of scientific change, drawing on Kuhn, although arguing against him, and Sellars. The basic notion is that scientific development includes the expansion of the explanatory power of theories. Galileo is then used as an example.In regards to Galileo, Pitt wants to claim that Galileo destroyed the priority of <i>scientia propter quid</i>scientia propter quid over <i>scientia quia</i>scientia quia by insisting on the descriptive power of the mathematical tool. Several quotes from the Dialogues are given regarding the superiority of mathematics, and the relation between human and divine understanding of mathematical truths. The essay goes under the assumption thatGaileo has made a sharp break with the long-standing geometric-mechanical tradition. For in insisting that the mathematics yields true knowledge, Galileo argues that mathematics has a more powerful use than merely to construct interesting models which serve to save the phenomena. (p.188)As Wallace (as Lennox) have argued, this is a mis-representation of Aristotelianism, although some Renaissance Aristotelianisms may fit the bill. The shift in Jesuit thinking and the death of Clavius has a great role to play here, I’m sure.The argument supporting the quote above rests on Galileo’s statements regarding realism about the mathematical structure of the world. Pitt’s main point is thatGalileo allow that a description of the structure of the universe is not an account of the causal principles governing the motion of the various components of this system. But it can be an explanation if exploted from the perspective of realism. (p.191)A slogan of Pitt’s article: the explanation is the demonstration (p.192). His case relies on mathematical demonstrations lacking “the causal principles traditionally deemed necessary for scientific knowledge as <i>scientia propeter quid.</i>scientia propeter quid. I’m not sure what these are. Regardless, the claim is that he is free to ignore them because he is a realist about mathematics.",

    "annote": "Descartes and Galileo never made any contact. Galileo was not aware of Descartes’ work. Descartes responded to Galileo’s condemnation, but without reading the <i>Dialogue</i>. Beeckman bring the Dialogue to Descartes in 1634, but takes it back with him after a few days (he did get a copy of the <i>Discorsi</i> upon publication) . Descartes reports favorably on the book to Mersenne, but is not impressed with the tides. HOWEVER, Descartes claims he arrived at the law of free-fall independently. Shea shows that he did not, he continuously uses an improper rule, which correlated force with speed (not acceleration) and assumed times are proportional to distances. However, “around 1630, Descartes’ understanding of physics underwent a profound change that led him to see the solution to the problem of free fall in an entirely different light and eventually to conclude that it was mathematically intractable” (p. 146). The change began in the <i>Regulae</i>, and its fruits embodied in the <i>Discourse</i>. For example, he writes to Mersenne in 1637 that the ration of free fall “is something that depends on so many others that I could not give an dequate account in a letter. All I can say is that neither Galileo nor anyone else can determine anything concerning this that is clear and dmeonstrative if he does not first know what weight is and does not have the true principles of physics.”\nDescartes read the <i>Discorsi</i>, but was dismissive. However, he applauded Galileo’s work on music, which he still claimed he arrived at first. (In general, Descartes stresses that he did not steal anything from Galileo). Shea lists Descartes’ criticisms, which are leveled at Aristotle’s Wheel and an assortment of others. Descartes also criticizes Mersenne’s version of Galileo’s mechanics as showing the how, not the why, of simple machines.",

He corresponded with Galileo concerning the Wheel (and was of help to him in his dealings with the Holy Office), but offered a different solution to it. Galileo gives praise to Guevara in the <i>Discorsi</i>Discorsi (p.165). Wallace clearly notes that the Wheel was used to motivate a cause for the cohesion of materials. “His problem was one of finding a sufficiently large number of vacuums to give good tensile strength of a column”His problem was one of finding a sufficiently large number of vacuums to give good tensile strength of a column. <b>Guevara’s Solution</b><b>Guevara’s Solution</b>Guevara’s Solution Guevara holds the wheel is useful for understanding “mixed”mixed motions. He discusses Aristotle’s solution, which boils down to the following: a single force moves different bodies differently. Consequently, when the circles are moved together, only one of them is moved with a natural motion appropriate to it, the other is being forced. The premise of the paradox, that the two circles moves together “naturally”naturally is therefore false, and the paradox is a mere sophism.Guevara’s solution is to decompose the motion of the circles into a rotation and a translation. He holds that while the circles share their rotation, they do not share the the translation motion. When the larger wheel rotate, the smaller wheel is translated more quickly than the larger and when the smaller rotates, the larger is translated more slowly than the smaller. However, both circles are composed from “an intinitely infinite”an intinitely infinite number of points, so that a one to one correspondence between points on the smaller circle and points on the larger circle can be maintained, although their motion are not the same.<b>Galileo’s Solution</b><b>Galileo’s Solution</b>Galileo’s Solution Wallace does not raise the question, but his discussion makes clear that the analogy between the infinite sided polygon in Aristotle’s wheel and matter is not obvious. In what way are they the same? The gaps in the wheel depend on a motion; without the motion there are no gaps!!<b>Apodictic Proof</b><b>Apodictic Proof</b>Apodictic Proof This section is unsatisfactory. Wallace shows that Guevara subscribed to the philosophy of science of the <i>Posterior Analytics</i>Posterior Analytics and that Galileo did also. However, apart from noting that Galileo’s solution to the wheel was attacked by his contemporaries and successors, and that it is not presented as demonstrable truth in the <i>Discorsi</i>Discorsi, his discussion is not informative. He claims that Galileo’s proof is not apodictic and basically leaves it at that, noting that this is strange, since Galileo was aware of Guevara’s superior proof.",

    "annote": "An overview of 50 years of Galileo’s work. Footnote 33 is interesting.The principles which are made explicit include the principle of the balance and the law of the lever; nonetheless Galileo’s language (in the mouth of Salviati, of course) implies that the science of resistance is founded on its own first principles. In fact, Sagredo asks for (and gets) a proof of the law of. the lever so as to have “entire and complete instruction\" (Drake, 1974a, p. 110). Galileo thus seems implicitly to deny that this is a subordinate science. In fact, I find him nowhere using language that suggest he thinks of his ’new sciences’ as in any way imperfect, subordinate or mixed, in the sense n which he remarks on such sciences in his early logical notes (see Wallace, in this volume; also Machamer, this volume).Footnote 34:Clavelin sees Galileo’s hesitation over the underlying cause of cohesion in the discovery of puzzles and contradictions in the concept of the infinite (1974, p. 446). I question, however, whether this is, in fact, the reason Galileo draws back from firmly asserting what he has conjectured about the nature of matter. His remark that reason must step in where the senses fail (see note 31 above) is made precisely in connection with this problem. Thus, it cannot be the limits of rationality alone that stop him; rather, it seems to be primarily the <i>lack of the visual model</i>lack of the visual model!!! which, in every instance, seems to be required for the establishment of fundamental principles.In the text itself, p.38, Wisan notes that the science is formally developed on the basis of principles from mechanics without reference to the cause of the phenomenon being studied.Some of the remainder is devoted to arguing that although Galileo fails to establish his fundamental principles with certainty and visual demonstration, he is not utilizing a confirmation-by-consequences methodology (p.43). He holds that the fundamental principles are confirmed by experience, but this is not through their consequences, but somehow directly. See also p.44 on Galileo’s relationship with first principles.Regarding the Athens paper: p. 44 is important. It argues that although first principles have a sort of leeway, Galileo attempts to find them in the real world.",

As with previous Cambridge histories of philosophy the subject is treated by topic and theme, and since history does not come packaged in neat bundles, the subject is also treated with great temporal flexibility, incorporating frequent reference to medieval and Renaissance ideas. The basic structure of the volumes corresponds to the way an educated seventeenth-century European might have organized the domain of philosophy. Thus, the history of science, religious doctrine, and politics feature very prominently. The narrative that unfolds begins with an intellectual world dominated by a synthesis of Aristotelianism and scholastic philosophy, but by the end of the period the mechanistic or ’corpuscularian’ philosophy has emerged and exerted its full impact on traditional metaphysics, ethics, theology, logic, and epistemology.",

    "annote": "QA803 .P55 1990 530/.01Howard Stein compares Newton’s refusal to lock natural philosophy into a preexisting system with the more rigid philosophical predilections of his near-contemporaries Christian Huygens and John Locke. Richard Arthur’s commentary provides a useful gloss on Stein’s essay. Lawrence Sklar puzzles over Newton’s attempts to provide a unified treatment of the various \"real quantities\": absolute space, time, and motion. According to Phillip Bricker’s responding essay, however, the distinctions Sklar draws do not go to the heart of the debate between realists and representationalists.J. E. McGuire and John Carriero debate Newtons views of the relationship between the Deity and the nature of time and space. Peter Achinstein looks at the tension between Newton’s methodological views and his advocacy of a corpuscular theory of light; he suggests that Newton could justify the latter by a \"weak\" inductive inference, but R.I.G. Hughes believes that this inference involves an induction Newton would be unwilling to make. Immanuel Kant’s critique of Newton’s view of gravity is discussed and amplified by Michael Friedman In response, Robert DiSalle raises a number of problems for Friedman’s analysis. Errol Harris and Philip Grier extend the discussion to the present day and look at the ethical implications of Newton’s work.",

It includes studies of Newton’s experimental methods in optics and their roots in Bacon and Boyle; Locke’s and Hume’s responses to Newton on the nature of matter, time, the structure of the sciences, and the limits of human inquiry. In addition it explores the use of Newtonian ideas in 18th-century pedagogy and the life sciences. Finally, it breaks new ground in analyzing the method of evidential reasoning heralded by the Principia, its nature, strength, and development in the subsequent three centuries of gravitational research. The volume will be of interest to historians of science and philosophy and philosophers interested in the nature of empiricism.",

By presenting a wide diversity of studies in a single volume, it provides authoritative introductions to scholarly contributions that have tended to be dispersed in journals and books not easily accessible to the general reader. While the core thread remains the theories and experimental practices of physics, the Handbook contains chapters on other dimensions that have their place in any rounded history. These include the role of lecturing and textbooks in the communication of knowledge, the contribution of instrument-makers and instrument-making companies in providing for the needs of both research and lecture demonstrations, and the growing importance of the many interfaces between academic physics, industry, and the military. –",

Modern physics.\n520aThis book brings together cutting-edge writing by more than twenty leading authorities on the history of physics from the seventeenth century to the present day. By presenting a wide diversity of studies in a single volume, it provides authoritative introductions to scholarly contributions that have tended to be dispersed in journals and books not easily accessible to the general reader. While the core thread remains the theories and experimental practices of physics, the Handbook contains chapters on other dimensions that have their place in any rounded history. These include the role of lecturing and textbooks in the communication of knowledge, the contribution of instrument-makers and instrument-making companies in providing for the needs of both research and lecture demonstrations, and the growing importance of the many interfaces between academic physics, industry, and the military. –cSource other than Library of Congress.\n650  0aPhysicsxHistory.\n650  0aSciencexHistory.\n700 1aBuchwald, Jed Z.,eeditor of compilation.\n700 1aFox, Robert,d1938-eeditor of compilation. 955 apc20 2013-05-10\n991br-SciRRhQC7i.O945 2013tCopy 1wGenBib",

    "abstract": "This volume is a collection of original essays focusing on a wide range of topics in the History and Philosophy of Science. It is a festschrift for Peter Machamer, which includes contributions from scholars who, at one time or another, were his students. The essays bring together analyses of issues and debates spanning from early modern science and philosophy through the 21st century. Machamer’s influence is reflected in the volume’s broad range of topics. These include: underdetermination, scientific practice, scientific models, mechanistic explanation in contemporary and historical science, values in science, the relationship between philosophy and psychology, experimentation, supervenience and reductionism.",

    "abstract": "Before publishing his landmark Meditations in 1641, Rene Descartes sent his manuscript to many leading thinkers to solicit their objections to his arguments. He included these objections, along with his own detailed replies, as part of the first edition. This unusual strategy gave Descartes a chance to address criticisms in advance and to demonstrate his willingness to consider diverse viewpoints—critical in an age when radical ideas could result in condemnation by church and state, or even death.Descartes and his Contemporaries recreates the tumultuous intellectual community of seventeenth-century Europe and provides a detailed, modern analysis of the Meditations in its historical context. The book’s chapters examine the arguments and positions of each of the objectors—Hobbes, Gassendi, Arnauld, Morin, Caterus, Bourdin, and others whose views were compiled by Mersenne. They illuminate Descartes’ relationships to the scholastics and particularly the Jesuits, to Mersenne’s circle with its debates about the natural sciences, to the Epicurean movements of his day, and to the Augustinian tradition. Providing a glimpse of the interactions among leading 17th-century intellectuals as they grappled with major philosophical issues, this book sheds light on how Descartes’ thought developed and was articulated in opposition to the ideas of his contemporaries.",

    "abstract": "Sir Isaac Newton’s association with “empiricism”—or rather, the set of traditions that constitutes “empiricism”—was clearly recognized during his lifetime and enshrined by Enlightenment philosophes as ideology after his death. Voltaire, for example, famously identified Newton’s physics and Locke’s metaphysics as the intellectual framework for the Age of Reason. The association became such a significant feature of the intellectual landscape that in the eighteenth century a thinker’s relation to Newton was often a matter of self-definition; by way of affinity or difference, it was a means of locating one’s advertised position in the philosophical spectrum. The influence of naturalistic and experimentalist thought on Newton was similarly well known. Roger Cotes highlighted it in his polemical preface to the Principia’s second edition. And Newton himself, although he cited sources only sparingly, explicitly affiliated himself in the Principia with the mathematical-experimental tradition of Galileo and Huygens. Moreover, from the 1690s onward Newton used language borrowed from the Baconian/Boylean experimental tradition; and, as the first Part of this volume demonstrates, his first opti- cal works were set in a Baconian natural-historical mold and were read as such by his contemporaries and successors. Yet the coupling of Newton and empiricism is not without problems....",

It includes studies of Newton’s experimental methods in optics and their roots in Bacon and Boyle; Locke’s and Hume’s responses to Newton on the nature of matter, time, the structure of the sciences, and the limits of human inquiry. In addition it explores the use of Newtonian ideas in 18th-century pedagogy and the life sciences. Finally, it breaks new ground in analyzing the method of evidential reasoning heralded by the Principia, its nature, strength, and development in the subsequent three centuries of gravitational research. The volume will be of interest to historians of science and philosophy and philosophers interested in the nature of empiricism.",
